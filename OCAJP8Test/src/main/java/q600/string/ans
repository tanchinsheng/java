It will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

It will throw a StringOutOfBoundsException.
//There is no such exception. The correct name is StringIndexOutOfBoundsException. But that is also not the correct answer.

It will throw an IndexOutOfBoundsException
//As per the API documentation of this method ( http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#charAt(int) ),
this method throws IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Although, in practice the method throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException,
which is a subclass of IndexOutOfBoundsException,
the implementation is free to throw some other subclass of IndexOutOfBoundsException.
Thus, you should rely only on the published API documentation instead of what it actually throws.

Explanation
Since indexing starts with 0, the maximum value that you can pass to charAt is length-1.
As per the API documentation for charAt, it throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if you pass an invalid value
(that is, if the index argument is negative or not less than the length of this string).
Both - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and StringIndexOutOfBoundsException,
extend IndexOutOfBoundsException and although in practice, the charAt method throws StringIndexOutOfBoundsException,
it is not a valid option because the implementation is free to throw some other exception as long as
it is an IndexOutOfBoundsException.  (There are questions on the exam on this aspect.)
