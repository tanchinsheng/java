Which of the following statements concerning the switch construct are true?

A character literal can be used as a value for a case label. //true
//boolean, long, float and double cannot be used.

A 'long' cannot be used as a switch variable. //true
//boolean, long, float and double cannot be used.

An empty switch block is a valid construct. //true

A switch block must have a default label.

If present, the default label must be the last of all the labels.
//Any order is valid.

Explanation
Here are the rules for a switch statement:
1. Only String, byte, char, short, int, (and their wrapper classes Byte,
Character, Short, and Integer), and enums can be used as types of a switch
variable. (String is allowed only since Java 7).
2. The case constants must be assignable to the switch variable.
For example, if your switch variable is of class String, your case labels
must use Strings as well.
3. The switch variable must be big enough to hold all the case constants.
For example, if the switch variable is of type char, then none of the case
 constants can be greater than 65535 because a char's range is from 0 to 65535.
4.  All case labels should be COMPILE TIME CONSTANTS.
5. No two of the case constant expressions associated with a switch statement
may have the same value.
6. At most one default label may be associated with the same switch statement.
