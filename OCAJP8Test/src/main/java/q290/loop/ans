What will the following code print when compiled and run?

wed

thu

fri

It will not compile.//true

It will throw an exception at run time.

Explanation
Notice the statement :
if(index == 3){                 
    break;             
}else {                  
    continue;             
}

In no situation can the control go beyond this statement in the for loop.
Therefore,  rest of the statements in the for loop are unreachable and so the code will not compile.
