import java.lang.*;

import java.lang.ArrayList;

import java.util.ArrayList;//true

import java.collections.ArrayList;

No import is necessary.

Explanation
Only java.lang package and the package in which the current class exists are automatically imported.
Class ArrayList is in java.util package, which is not imported automatically.
Note that classes in the default package (i.e. the package with no name) cannot be imported by classes in other
(i.e. non default) packages. This is why you should not use the default package for creating classes.
