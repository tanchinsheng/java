What will the following code print?

It will not compile.

It will throw an exception at runtime.

It will print numbers from 0 to 8

It will print numbers from 0 to 3

It will print numbers from 0 to 4//true

Explanation
This is a straight forward loop that contains a labelled break statement.
A labelled break breaks out of the loop that is marked with the given label.
Therefore, a labelled break is used to break out from deeply nested loops to the outer loops.
Here, there is only one nested loop so the break; and break JACK; are same, but consider the following code:
    public static void crazyLoop(){
      int c = 0;
      JACK: while (c < 8){
        JILL: System.out.println("c = "+c);
        for(int k = 0; k<c; k++){
            System.out.println(" k = "+k+" c = "+c);
            if (c > 3) break JACK;
        }
        c++;
      }
    }
This code prints:
c = 0
c = 1
  k = 0 c = 1
c = 2
  k = 0 c = 2
  k = 1 c = 2
c = 3
  k = 0 c = 3
  k = 1 c = 3
  k = 2 c = 3
c = 4
  k = 0 c = 4
As you can see, in this case, break JACK; will break out from the outer most loop (the while loop).
If break JACK; is replaced by break; it will print:
c = 0
c = 1
  k = 0 c = 1
c = 2
  k = 0 c = 2
  k = 1 c = 2
c = 3
  k = 0 c = 3
  k = 1 c = 3
  k = 2 c = 3
c = 4
  k = 0 c = 4
c = 5
  k = 0 c = 5
c = 6
  k = 0 c = 6
c = 7
  k = 0 c = 7
This shows that a break without a label only breaks out of the current loop.
