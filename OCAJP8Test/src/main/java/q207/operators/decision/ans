What is the result of executing the following fragment of code:

Compile time error.

It will print true;

It will print false;//true

Runtime error.

It will print nothing.

Explanation
All an if() needs is a boolean.
Now, b1 != b2 returns false which is a boolean and so the expression
becomes b2 = false.  It returns false which is again a boolean.
So there is no error and it prints false. Remember that every
expression has a return value (which is actually the Left
Hand Side of the expression).
For example, The value of the expressing i = 10 , is 10 (an int).
