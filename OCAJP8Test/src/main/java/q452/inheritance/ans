What will the following code print when run?

It will not compile.

It will throw ClassCastException at runtime.

a = class AA
aa = class AA//true

a = class A
aa = class AA

Explanation
getClass is a public instance method in Object class. That means it is polymorphic.
In other words, this method is bound at run time and so it returns the name of
the class of the actual object to which the reference points.
Here, at run time, both - a and aa, point to an object of class AA. So both will
print AA.
