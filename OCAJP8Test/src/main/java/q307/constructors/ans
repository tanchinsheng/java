Given a class named Test, which of these would be valid definitions for a
constructor for the class?

Test(Test b) { }//true
//The constructor can take the same type as a parameter.

Test Test( ) { }
//A constructor cannot return anything.

private final Test( ) { }
// A constructor cannot be final, static or abstract.

void Test( ) { }
//A constructor cannot return anything. Not even void.

public static void Test(String args[ ] ) { }
//A constructor cannot be final, static or abstract.
