What will the following lines of code print?          

System.out.println(1 + 5 < 3 + 7);         
System.out.println( (2 + 2) >= 2 + 3);

They will not compile.

1false10
false

true
false //true

false
false

Explanation
Comparison operators have lower precedence than mathematical operators.
Therefore, 1 + 5 < 3 + 7 is evaluated as (1 + 5) < (3 + 7) i.e. 6<10, which prints true.
Similarly,  (2 + 2) >= 2 + 3 is evaluated as  (2 + 2) >= (2 + 3) i.e. 4>=5, which prints false.

If you have an expression,  2 + (2 >= 2) + 3, it would be tempting to answer 2true3,
but actually, it would not compile because it would resolve to 2 + true + 3 and + operator is not
overloaded for anything except String. Here, neither of the operands of + operator is a String.
