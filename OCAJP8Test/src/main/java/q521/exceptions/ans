Which of the following are standard Java exception classes?

java.io.FileNotFoundException //true

java.io.InputException
//There is an java.io.IOException but no InputException or OutputException.

java.lang.CPUError
//There is no such class.

java.lang.MemoryException
//There is a java.lang.OutOfMemoryError but no MemoryException. There is also a java.lang.StackOverflowError.

java.lang.SecurityException //true
//Java has a java.lang.SecurityException. This exception extends RuntimeException and is thrown by the
security manager upon security violation. For example, when a java program runs in a sandbox (such as an applet)
and it tries to use prohibited APIs such as File I/O, the security manager throws this exception.
Since this exception is explicitly thrown using the new keyword by a security manager class,
it can be considered to be thrown by the application programmer.
