Which of the following lambda expressions can be used to invoke a method that accepts a java.util.function.Predicate as an argument?

Please select 2 options

x -> System.out.println(x)
//The body part of the lambda expression that is meant to capture the Predicate interface must return a boolean
(because the only abstract method in this interface returns boolean) but here, it returns void.

x -> System.out.println(x);
//1. The body part must return a boolean but this returns void.
2. This is syntactically invalid as well because of the semi-colon.


x -> x == null //true

() -> true
//The implementation of Predicate interface must have a method that takes exactly one parameter. Here, the parameter list is empty.

x->true //true
