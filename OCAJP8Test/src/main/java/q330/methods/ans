Identify the correct statements:

It will not compile because it does not implement setAngle method.
//There is no requirement that a class has to have a setter as well as a getter.

It will not compile because ANGLE cannot be private.
//Any field can be made private.

It will not compile because getAngle() has no body.//true

It will not compile because ANGLE field is not initialized.
//Since it is a static field, it will get a default value of 0.0.

It will not compile because of the name of the method Main instead of main.
//A class can have a method named Main. Although, since it is not same as main,
it will not be considered the standard main method that the JVM can invoke when
the program is executed.
