Given the following classes, what will be the output of compiling and running the class Truck?

Compiler error at line 3.

Runtime error at line 3.

It will print:  Automobile: drive Truck: drive Automobile: drive in that order.

It will print: Automobile: drive Truck: drive Truck: drive in that order.

It will print: Automobile: drive Automobile: drive Automobile: drive in that order.

Explanation
Since Truck is a subclass of Automobile, a = t will be valid at compile time
as well at runtime. But a cast is needed to make t = (Truck) a; work.
This will be ok at compile time but if at run time 'a' does not refer to
an object of class Truck, a ClassCastException will be thrown.
Now, method to be executed is decided at run time and it depends
on the actual class of object referred to by the variable.
Here, at line 4, variable a refers to an object of class Truck.
So Truck's drive() will be called which prints Truck: drive.
This is polymorphism in action!
