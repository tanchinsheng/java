When the program is run without any arguments, args gets assigned a string array of size 0. 
So NullPointerException or ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException are out of question. Thus, the first call becomes : 
int k = m1(0);  

Follow through the code like this: 
1. Method m1() uses pre-increment operation. Therefore, first i is incremented and then the new value of i is returned. 
2. Thus, k gets the value of 1.  
3. Expand the += operator as: 
k = k + 3 + ++k;  

This becomes (remember that k = 1 at this point): 
k = 1 + 3 + (++k) i.e. 
k = 1 + 3 + 2; (at this point value of k is 2 because of ++k). But the value of Right Hand Side has not yet been assigned to k. 
k = 6; 6 is assigned to k thereby overwriting the value of 2.  Therefore, the final value of k is 6.
