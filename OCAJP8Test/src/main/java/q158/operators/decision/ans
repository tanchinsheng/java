Caught AE

2 10
5 2

It will not compile.

Explanation
% is the modulus operator. It returns the remainder of a division.
Thus, dx = x%5 assigns 0 to dx because 5 divides 10 perfectly (no remainder).
y/dx therefore throws an ArithmeticException because of division by 0
 which is caught by the catch block.
In the catch block, "Caught AE" is printed" and then dx is set to 2 and
dy becomes 20/2 i.e.10
x = x/dx => x becomes 10/2 i.e. 5 and y = y/dy => becomes 20/10 i.e. 2
