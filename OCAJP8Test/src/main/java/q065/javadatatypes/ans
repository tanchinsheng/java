Although confusing, it is legal to have multiple underscores between two digits.

Explanation
You may use underscore for all kinds of numbers including long,
double, float, binary, as well as hex.  For example, the following
are all valid numbers - int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE; float f = 9898_7878.333_333f;
int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;
