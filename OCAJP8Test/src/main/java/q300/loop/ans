To determine the output you have to run through the loop one iteration at a time in your mind:

Iteration 1: s is "a". It is not equal to "b" so, it will print "a", and then "a again".

Iteration 2: s is "b". It is equal to "b", so the first if will execute "continue", 
which mean the rest of the code in the loop will not be executed (thus b and b again will not be printed), 
and the next iteration will start. Note that the second if is not executed at all because of the continue in the first if.

Iteration 3: s is "c", both the if conditions are not satisfied. So "c" and "c again" will be printed.
