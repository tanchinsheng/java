Given the following code, which of these statements are true?

It will print 3, 2 when line 1 is replaced by break;//true

It will print 3, 2 when line 1 is replaced by continue.

It will print 4, 3 when line 1 is replaced by continue.//true

It will print 4, 4 when line 1 is replaced by i = m++;

It will print 3, 3 when line 1 is replaced by i = 4;//true

Explanation
This is a simple loop. All you need to do is execute each statement in your head.
For example, if line 1 is replaced by break:
1. k=0, m=0
2. iteration 1: i=0     
2.1 k = 1     
2.2 i == 2 is false     
2.3 m = 1
3. iteration 2: i = 1     
3.1 k=2     
3.2 i==2 is false     
3.3 m = 2
4. iteration 3: i = 2     
4.1 k=3     
4.2 i==2 is true     
4.3 break
5. print 3, 2
