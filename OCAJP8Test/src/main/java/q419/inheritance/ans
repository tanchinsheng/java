Which statements about the following code are correct?

Code for interface House will cause compilation to fail.

Code for class MyHouse will cause compilation to fail

Line at //1 will cause compilation to fail.

Line at //2 will cause compilation to fail.

The code will compile successfully.//true

Explanation
There is no problem with the code. It is perfectly valid for a subinterface
to override a default method of the base interface.
A class that implements an interface can also override a default method.
It is valid for MyHouse to say that it implements Bungalow as well as
House even though House is redundant because Bungalow is a House anyway.
It will actually print 101 Smart str.
