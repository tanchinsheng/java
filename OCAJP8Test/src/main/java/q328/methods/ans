Which of the following methods does not return any value?

public doStuff() throws FileNotFoundException, IllegalArgumentException{     
//valid code not shown
}
//It is missing the return type. Every method must have a return type specified
in its declaration. It could be a valid constructor though if the class is
named doStuff because the constructors don't return anything, not even void.

public null doStuff() throws FileNotFoundException, IllegalArgumentException{     
//valid code not shown
}
//null can be a return value not a return type because null is not a type.

public doStuff() {     
//valid code not shown
}
//This is not a valid method because there is no return type declared.
Although it can be a valid constructor if the name of the class is doStuff.

public void doStuff() throws FileNotFoundException, IllegalArgumentException{     
//valid code not shown
}//true
//A method that does not return anything should declare its return type as void.
Note that this is different from constructors.
A constructor also doesn't return anything but for a constructor,
you don't specify any return type at all. That is how a constructor is
differentiated from a regular method.

private doStuff() {     
//valid code not shown
}
//This is not a valid method because there is no return type declared.
Although it can be a valid constructor if the name of the class is doStuff.
