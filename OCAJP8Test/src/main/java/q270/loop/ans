Explanation
In such type of questions, you will need to work out the values of the loop variables
for every iteration (unless you can recognize the pattern) on your worksheet.
Beginning i=0, j=10
Iteration 1: i<=j is true, i becomes 1 and j becomes 9
Iteration 2: i<=j is true, i becomes 2 and j becomes 8
Iteration 3: i<=j is true, i becomes 3 and j becomes 7
Iteration 4: i<=j is true, i becomes 4 and j becomes 6
Iteration 5: i<=j is true, i becomes 5 and j becomes 5
Iteration 6: i<=j is true, i becomes 6 and j becomes 4
Iteration 7: i<=j is false so the while loop is not entered.
Print 6 and 4.
