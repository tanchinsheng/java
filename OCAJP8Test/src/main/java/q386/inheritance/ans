Which statements, when inserted in the code below,
will cause an exception at run time?

b = b1;
//There won't be a problem anytime because B1 is a B

b2 = b;
//It fails at Compile time as an object referenced by b may not be a B2,
so an explicit cast will be needed.

b1 = (B1) b;//true
//It will pass at compile time but fail at run time as the actual object
referenced by b is not a B1.

b2 = (B2) b1;
//It will not compile because b1 can never point to an object of class B2.

b1 = (B) b1;
//This won't compile. Another cast is needed. i.e. b1 = (B1) (B) b1;
