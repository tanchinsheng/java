In Java, array numbering starts from 0. So in this case, twoD is an array containing 3 other arrays. 
twoD[0] is { 1, 2, 3} , twoD[1] is { 4, 5, 6, 7}, and twoD[2] is  { 8, 9, 10 }.  
Thus, twoD[1].length is 4 and twoD[1][2] is the third element in { 4, 5, 6, 7}, which is 6.  
In Java, arrays are just like regular Objects and arrays of different types have different class names. 
For example, the class name of an int[] is [I and the class name for int[][] is [[I.  
For array classes, the isArray() method of a Class returns true. 
For example, twoD.getClass().isArray() will return true.  
There are a few questions in the exam that require you to know about this.
