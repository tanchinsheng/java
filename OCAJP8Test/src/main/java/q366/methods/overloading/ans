What will the following code print when run?

In int
In char//true

In char
In int

In int
In int

In char
In char

It will not compile.

Explanation
It looks confusing but it is a simple question.
Remember that whenever two methods are applicable for a method call,
the one that is most specific to the argument is chosen.
In case of m(a), a is an int, which cannot be passed as a char
(because an int cannot fit into a char). Therefore, only m(int) is applicable.
In case of m(c), c is a char, which can be passed as an int as well as a char.
Therefore, both the methods are applicable. However, m(char) is most specific
therefore that is chosen over m(int).
