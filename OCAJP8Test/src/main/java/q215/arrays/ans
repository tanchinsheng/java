Which of the following code fragments will successfully initialize a
two-dimensional array of chars named cA with a size such that cA[2][3]
refers to a valid element?

1,3

4,5

2,3

1,2,3

2 //true

Explanation
1 and 3 declare a two dimensional array alright but they create the array of size 2, 3.
And cA[2][3] means we need an array of size 3, 4 because the numbering starts from 0.

4 : You cannot put array size information on left hand side of equals sign.

5 : This is a one dimensional array and that too of strings.

Note that a java String is not equivalent to 1 dimensional array of chars.
This leaves us with only one choice 2.
