What will the following program print?

19//true

20

21

22

It will enter an infinite loop.

Explanation
When the first iteration of outer do-while loop starts, var is 20.
Now, the inner loop executes till i becomes 21.
Now, the condition for outer do-while is checked, while( 22 < 20 ),
[i is 22 because of the last i++>var check], thereby making var 19.
And as the condition is false, the outer loop also ends.
So, 19 is printed.
