What will be the output of the following code snippet?

int a = 1;
int[] ia = new int[10];
int b = ia[a];
int c = b + a;
System.out.println(b = c);

0

1 //true

2

true

false

Explanation
1. All the elements of an array of primitives are automatically initialized
by default values, which is 0 for numeric types and false for boolean.
Therefore, ia[1] is 0.

2. = is not same as ==. The statement b = c assigns c (whose value is 1) to b.
which is then printed.
