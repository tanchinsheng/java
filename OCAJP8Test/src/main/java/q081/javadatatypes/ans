Given the following class, which statements can be inserted at line 1 without causing
the code to fail compilation?Given the following class, which statements can be
inserted at line 1 without causing the code to fail compilation?

a++;
//Here, 'a' is an instance variable of type int.
Therefore, it will be given a default value of Zero and so it
need not be initialized explicitly.

b++;

c++;
//Here 'c' is a class variable (also called as static variable) of type int
so it will be given a default value of Zero and so it need not be initialized explicitly.

d++;
//This will not compile because 'd' is not initialized.
Note that automatic variables (also called as method local variables
i.e. variables declared within a method) have to be explicitly initialized.

e++;

Explanation
All the instance or static variables are given a default values if they are not
explicitly initialized. All numeric variable are given a value of zero or
equivalent to zero (i.e. 0 for integral types and 0.0 for double/float).
Booleans are initialized to false and objects are initialized to null.

Note that local (aka automatic) variables, such as the variables d and e
in the code given here, are not initialized automatically.
They have to be initialized explicitly.
However, it is ok to leave them uninitialized if you don't use them
anywhere in the code (as is the case with the variable d).
