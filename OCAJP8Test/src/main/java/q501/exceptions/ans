Consider the following hierarchy of Exception classes :  

java.lang.RuntimeException   
    +-------- IndexOutOfBoundsException                   
        +---------ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException  

Which of the following statements are correct for a method that can throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds as well as 
StringIndexOutOfBounds Exceptions but does not have try catch blocks to catch the same?

The method calling this method will either have to catch these 2 exceptions or declare them in its throws clause.

It is ok if it declares just throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException //true

It must declare throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException

It is ok if it declares just throws IndexOutOfBoundsException //true

It does not need to declare any throws clause //true

Explanation
Note that both the exceptions are RuntimeExceptions so there is no need to catch these. 
But it is ok even if the method declares them explicitly.
