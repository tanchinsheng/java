Explanation
ArrayList's remove(Object ) method returns a boolean. It returns true if the element is found in the list and
false otherwise. The JavaDoc API description of this method is important for the exam -

public boolean remove(Object o)
Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present (optional operation).
If this list does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
More formally, removes the element with the lowest index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i)))
(if such an element exists).
Returns true if this list contained the specified element (or equivalently, if this list changed as a result of the call).

Observe that it does not remove all occurences of the element. It removes just the first one.
In this case, only the first "a" will be removed.
