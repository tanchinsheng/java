Observe that the method parameter k in checkIt shadows the instance variable k. 
Therefore, any changes made to k in checkIt will not affect the instance variable k. 
For checkIt method to access the instance variable k, you need to do this.k.  k-->0 means, 
first compare the value of k with 0, and then reduce it by 1. (As opposed to --k>0, which means, 
first reduce the value of k by 1 and then compare with 0).  
In the printThem method, k refers to the instance variable. 
You need to reduce it by 1 after each iteration. 
Therefore, System.out.print(k--); will do.
