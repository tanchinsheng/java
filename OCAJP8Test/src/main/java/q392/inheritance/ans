Which of the following constructors MUST exist in SuperClass for SubClass to
compile correctly?

It is ok even if no explicit constructor is defined in SuperClass
//The //2 will fail as it needs a constructor taking an int!

public SuperClass(int a, int b)
//It is not used anywhere so it is not necessary.

public SuperClass(int a)//true
//Because it is called in the second constructor of SubClass.

public SuperClass()//true
//The default no args constructor will not be provided because SuperClass
has to define one arg constructor.

only public SuperClass(int a) is required.
//You'll have to explicitly define a no args constructor because it is needed
in the first constructor of SubClass.
