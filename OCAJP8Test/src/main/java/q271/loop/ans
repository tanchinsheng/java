Explanation
In such type of questions, you will need to work out the values of the loop
variables for every iteration
(unless you can recognize the pattern) on your worksheet.
Beginning i=0, j=10, count = 0
Iteration 1: i<j is true, i becomes 1, j becomes 9, count becomes 1
Iteration 2: i<j is true, i becomes 2, j becomes 8, count becomes 2
Iteration 3: i<j is true, i becomes 3, j becomes 7, count becomes 3
Iteration 4: i<j is true, i becomes 4, j becomes 6, count becomes 4
Iteration 5: i<j is true, i becomes 5, j becomes 5, count becomes 5
Iteration 6: i<j is false so the while loop is not entered.
Print 5 5 5.
