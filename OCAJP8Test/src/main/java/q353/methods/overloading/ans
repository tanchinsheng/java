Explanation
Always remember: Methods are overridden and variables are shadowed.
Here, b refers to an object of class Beta so b.getH() will always call
the overridden (subclass's method). However, the type of reference of b is Baap.
so b.h will always refer to Baap's h.  Further, inside Beta's getH(),
Beta's h will be accessed instead of Baap's h because you are accessing this.h
('this' is implicit) and the type of this is Beta.
