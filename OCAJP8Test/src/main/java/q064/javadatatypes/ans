What can be inserted in the above code so that it will compile and run without any problem?

double x = 0xb10_000;
//0x implies the following digits must be interpreted as Hexadecimal digits and
b is a valid Hexadecimal digit.

float x = 0b10_000;
//A number starting with 0b (or 0B) implies that it is written in binary.
Since 10000 can fit into a float, an explicit cast is not required.
Note that when you specify the bit pattern using binary or hex,
an explicit cast is not required even if the number specified using
the bit pattern is larger than what a float can hold.

float x = 0b20_000;
//Since it starts with 0b, that means you are writing the number in binary digits
(i.e. 0 or 1). But 2 is not a valid binary digit.

float x = 0b10_000f;
//This is invalid because the floating point suffices f, F or d, D are
used only when using decimal system and not while using binary.
However, since f is a valid digit in hexadecimal system,
a hex number may end with an f although it will not be interpreted
as float but as the digit f. Thus, float x = 0x10_000f; and float x = 10_000f;
are valid because they are written in hex and decimal respectively but
float x = 0b10_000f;  is invalid because is written in binary.
Note that a floating point number cannot be written in Octal.
Therefore, float x = 010_000f; is valid but it is not octal
even though it starts with a 0. It is interpreted in decimal.

long x = 0b10000L;

double d = 0b10_000D;
//A floating point number written in binary or hex cannot use any suffix for float.
But a floating point number written in decimal can use the floating point
suffices f, F, d, and D.
Thus, float dx = 0xff; is valid but the f here is not for indicating that
it is a float but is interpreted as the hex digit F.

Explanation
The real exam contains a few questions that test you on how to write numbers
in binary. You might want to go through Section 3.10.1 and 3.10.2 of Java
Language Specification to understand how this works.
