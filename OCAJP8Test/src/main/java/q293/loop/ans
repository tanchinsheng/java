What will be the output when the following program is run?

0 0 will be printed twice.

0 0 will be printed once.//true

It will keep on printing 0 0

It will not compile.

It will print 0 0 and then 0 1.

Explanation
++j and i++ do not matter in this case.
The loop will not execute even once since j is not less than i at the start of
the loop so the condition fails and the program will print 0 0 just once.
