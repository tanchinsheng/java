You are writing a piece of code that determines tax rate on a given grossIncome.
The tax rate is to be computed as follows -
   If grossIncome is less than or equals to 18000, taxRate is 0.
   If grossIncome is more than 18000 but less than or equal to 36000, taxRate is 10%
   If grossIncome is more that 36000, taxRate is 20%.

Which of following code fragments do it correctly?

double taxRate = grossIncome<=18000 ? 0 : (grossIncome<=36000) ? .1 : .2;//true

double taxRate = .2;
taxRate = grossIncome<=18000?0:.1;
taxRate = grossIncome<=36000?.1:.2;
//It will assign .1 to taxRate even if grossIncome is less than 18000.

double taxRate = 0;
if(grossIncome>36000) taxRate = .20;
if(grossIncome>18000 && grossIncome<=36000) taxRate = .10;//true

double taxRate = .2;
if(grossIncome>36000) {    
    taxRate = .2;
}   else taxRate = 0;
if(grossIncome>18000 ) {    
    taxRate = .1;
}
//This will assign .1 to taxRate even if grossIncome is greater than 36000.

double taxRate = 0;
taxRate = grossIncome>18000?grossIncome<=36000?.1:.2:0 //true

Explanation
This question is assigned a rating of tough only because it is a bit
time consuming to check each option. Otherwise, it is quite easy to
figure out what each option is doing. You may expect such questions in the exam.
