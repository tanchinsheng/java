What will the following program print when run without any command line argument?

has params

has params
no params //true

no params

It will not compile.

Explanation
Remember that the args array is never null.
If the program is run without any arguments, args points to a
String array of length 0. Therefore, hasParams will be true and it
 will print "has params".  Since there is no else, the subsequent
code block will also be executed and it will print "no params".
Note that it is not syntactically wrong to have section of code wrapped in { }.
