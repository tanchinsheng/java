Explanation
In an array access, the expression to the left of the brackets appears
to be fully evaluated before any part of the expression within the brackets
is evaluated. In the expression a[(a=b)[3]], the expression a is fully
evaluated before the expression (a=b)[3]; this means that the original
value of a is fetched and remembered while the expression (a=b)[3]
is evaluated. This array referenced by the original value of a is
then subscripted by a value that is element 3 of another array
(possibly the same array) that was referenced by b and is now
also referenced by a. So, it is actually a[0] = 1. Note that
 evaluation of the expression to the left of the brackets completes
 abruptly, no part of the expression within the brackets will appear
to have been evaluated.
