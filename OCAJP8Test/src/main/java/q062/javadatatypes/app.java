     * Beginning with Java 7, you can include underscores in between the digits.
     * This helps in writing long numbers. For example, if you want to write 1
     * million, you can write: 1_000_000, which is easier than 1000000 for
     * humans to interpret. Note that you cannot start or end a value with an
     * underscore though. Thus, 100_ or _100 are invalid values. _100 is
     * actually a valid variable name! You may use underscore for all kinds of
     * numbers including long, double, float, binary, as well as hex.  For
     * example, the following are all valid numbers - int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE;
     * float f = 9898_7878.333_333f; int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;
