What will the following program print when run?

43//true

7

It will not compile.

It will throw an exception at runtime.

None of the above.

Explanation
This is quite simple, toString() is called on the Object of class SubClass.
Subclass's toString() calls super class's toString() which returns String 4
(not an integer 4!). It then appends "3" to it. So the final value is "43".
