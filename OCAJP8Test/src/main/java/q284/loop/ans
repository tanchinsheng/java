Consider the following code written by a new developer:  

while(true){         
//additional valid code        
 if(isDone()) break; }  

What can be done to make this code more readable?

You had to select 1 option

Use a for loop 
The following is how it can be done using a for loop: 
for(;!isDone();) { //additional valid code }

Use the enhanced for loop

use do-while instead of while.//Correct
In the current state, the actual loop breaker condition is coded far away from the while condition. 
This reduces readability because it isn't immediately known when the loop breaks. 
Therefore, it should be changed to: do{ } while( !isDone() );

Use continue instead of break.
