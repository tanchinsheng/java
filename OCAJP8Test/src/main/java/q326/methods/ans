Consider the following class...

By declaring x as static, main can access this.x

By declaring x as public, main can access this.x

By declaring x as protected, main can access this.x

main cannot access this.x as it is declared now.//true
//Because main() is a static method. It does not have 'this'!

By declaring x as private, main can access this.x

Explanation
It is not possible to access x from main without making it static.
Because main is a static method and only static members are accessible
from static methods. There is no 'this' available in main so none of the
this.x are valid.
