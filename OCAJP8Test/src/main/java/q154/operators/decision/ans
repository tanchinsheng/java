It will print 0, 1 and 2.

It will not print anything.

Compilation error. //true
//It will say 'case', 'default' or '}' expected at compile time.

Runtime error

None of the above.

Explanation
You cannot have unlabeled block of code inside a switch block.
Any code block must succeed a case label (or default label).
Since there is no case statement in this switch block,
there is no way the line flag = true; can be reached!
Therefore, it will not compile.
