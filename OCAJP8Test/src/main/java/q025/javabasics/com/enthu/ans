Base
//Only if you import the whole package containing the class or import the class first.

By importing the package com.* and referring to the class as enthu.Base
//package 'com' does not contain Base.

importing com.* is illegal.
//It is perfectly legal but will not help here.

By importing com.enthu.* and referring to the class as Base. //true

By referring to the class as com.enthu.Base. //true

Explanation
A class or interface can be referred to by using its fully qualified name or its simple name.
Using the fully qualified name will always work, but to use the simple name either the class must
be in the same package or it has to be imported. By importing com.enthu.* all the classes from the
package will be imported and can be referred to using simple names. Importing com.* will not import
the subpackage enthu. It will only import the classes in package com.
