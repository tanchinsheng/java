Consider the following two classes (in the same package but defined in different source files):

You are assigned the task of refactoring the Square class to make it better in terms of encapsulation.
What changes will you make to this class?


Make setSide() method private.

Make getArea() method private.
//It should be made public so that other classes can get the area.

Make side and area fields private.
//There is no need to keep the area field because that would amount to duplicating the data.
If you change side, the value of area will become obsolete.

Make the side field private and remove the area field.//true

Change getArea method to: //true
public double getArea(){ return side*side; }

Add a setArea() method.
//This is not required because area is calculated using the side.
So if you allow other classes to set the area,
it could make side and area inconsistent with each other.
