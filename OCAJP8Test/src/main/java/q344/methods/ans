Select the correct order of restrictiveness for access modifiers...
(First one should be least restrictive)

public < protected < package (i.e. no modifier) < private//true
//That's right, protected is less restrictive than package.

public < package (i.e. no modifier) < protected < private

public < protected < private < package (i.e. no modifier)
//The default accessibility is more restrictive than protected,
but less restrictive than private.

protected < package (i.e. no modifier) < private < public

depends on the implementation of the class or method.

Explanation
Members with default accessibility are only accessible within the class
itself and from classes in the same package.
Protected members are in addition accessible from subclasses. Members with
private accessibility are only accessible
within the class itself.
