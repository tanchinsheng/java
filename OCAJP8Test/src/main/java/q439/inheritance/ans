An abstract method cannot be overridden.

True

False//true

Explanation
Abstract methods are meant to be overridden in the subclass.
Abstract methods describe a behavior but do not implement it.
So the subclasses have to override it to actually implement the behavior.
A subclass may chose not to override it, in which case, the
subclass will have to be abstract too.
