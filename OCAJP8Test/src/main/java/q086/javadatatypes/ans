What can be inserted in the above code so that it can compile without any error?

al.add(111);
//You cannot box an int into a Double object.

System.out.println(al.indexOf(1.0));
//indexOf's accepts Object as a parameter.
Although 1.0 is not an object, it will be boxed into a Double object.

System.out.println(al.contains("string"));

Double d = al.get(al.length);
//ArrayList does not have a field named length.
It does have a method named size() though.
So you can do: Double d = al.get(al.size());
It will compile but will throw IndexOutOfBoundsException at run time in this case
because al.size() will return 0 and al.get(0) will try to get
the first element in the list.

Explanation
Note that al is declared as ArrayList<Double>,
therefore the add method is typed to accept only a Double.
