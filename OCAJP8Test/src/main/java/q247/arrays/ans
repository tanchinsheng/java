Which of these array declarations and initializations are NOT legal?

int[ ] i[ ] = { { 1, 2 }, { 1 }, { }, { 1, 2, 3 } } ;

int i[ ] = new int[2] {1, 2} ;//true
//If you give the elements explicitly you can't give the size.
So it should be just int[] { 1, 2 } or just { 1, 2 }

int i[ ][ ] = new int[ ][ ] { {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6} } ;

int i[ ][ ] = { { 1, 2 }, new int[ 2 ] } ;

int i[4] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 } ;//true
//You cannot specify the size on left hand side .

Explanation
If you explicitly specify the members then you can't give the size.
So option 2 is wrong.
The size of the array is never given during the declaration of an array reference.
So option 5 is wrong.
The size of an array is always associated with the array instance,
not the array reference.
