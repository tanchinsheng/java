What will the following code print when compiled and run:

1

1 0

2 1//true
//--k>0 implies, decrement the value of k and then compare with 0.
Therefore, the loop will only execute twice, printing 2 and 1.
Had it been k-->0, it would imply, first compare k with 0, and then decrement k.
In this case, the loop would execute thrice, printing 2, 1, and 0.

2 1 0

It will keeping printing numbers in an infinite loop.

It will not compile.
