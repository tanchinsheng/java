What will the following code print?

A million 1

A million 2

Compilation error because of //1

Compilation error because of //2

Compilation error because of //3

Compilation error because of //1 and //3 //true

Explanation
1. You may use underscores (but not commas) to format a number for better
code readability. So //1 is invalid.

2. Adding underscores doesn't actually change the number.
The compiler ignores the underscores. So 1_000_000 and 1000000
are actually same and you cannot have two case blocks with the same value.
Therefore, the second case at //3 is invalid.

You may use underscore for all kinds of numbers including long,
double, float, binary, as well as hex.  
For example, the following are all valid numbers -
int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE;
float f = 9898_7878.333_333f;
int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;
