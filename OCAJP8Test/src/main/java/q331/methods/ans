Which of the following statements are true?

private keyword can never be applied to a class.
//private, protected and public can be applied to a nested class.
Although not too important for the exam, you should still know the following terminology:
A top level class is a class that is not a nested class.
A nested class is any class whose declaration occurs within the body of another class or interface.

synchronized keyword can never be applied to a class.// true

synchronized keyword may be applied to a non-primitive variable.
//It can only be applied to a method or a block.

final keyword can never be applied to a class.

A final variable can be hidden in a subclass.// true
//If the class declares a field with a certain name, then the declaration of that field is said to hide any
and all accessible declarations of fields with the same name in superclasses,
and superinterfaces of the class.

For example,
class Base{    
    int i=10;
}

class Sub extends Base{   
    int i=20; //This i hides Base's i.   
}
...
Sub s = new Sub();
int k = s.i; //assigns 20 to k.

Explanation
final keyword when applied to a class means the class cannot be subclassed,
when applied to a method means the method cannot be overridden
(it can be overloaded though) and when applied to a variable means that
the variable is a constant.
