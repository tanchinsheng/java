When you try to access a local variable, the compiler makes sure that it is initialized in all the cases. 
If it finds that there is a case in which it may not be initialized then it flags an error. 

For example:  
int i; 
if( somecondition) i = 20; 
int k = i;  

Here, if some condition returns false, then i remains uninitialized 
hence the compiler flags an error. In the given question: As there is no break after case 2, 
val will always be initialized in the switch block. So it will compile and run fine. 
Note that it will not compile if break is placed after case 2 because the compiler 
will figure out that in certain cases val may be left uninitialized.
