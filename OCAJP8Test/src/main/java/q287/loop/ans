What will the following code print when compiled and run:

5
6

5
6
7

It will keep printing 5.

It will not compile.//true
//In Java, a while or do/while construct takes an expression that returns a boolean.
But unlike a for loop, you cannot put instantiation and increment sections in the
while condition.  Therefore, for(int k=5;k<7;) is valid but while(int k=5;k<7;) is not.

It will throw an exception at run time.
