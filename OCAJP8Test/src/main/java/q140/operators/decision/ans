Which of the following code snippets will print exactly 10?

1.  Object t = new Integer(106);     
    int k = ((Integer) t).intValue()/10;     
    System.out.println(k);

2.  System.out.println(100/9.9);
3.  System.out.println(100/10.0);
4.  System.out.println(100/10);
5.  System.out.println(3 + 100/10*2-13);

1 //true

2
//Since one of the operands (9.9) is a double,
it wil perform a real division and will print 10.1010101010101

3
//Since one of the operands (10.0) is a double,
it will perform a real division and will print 10.0

4 //true

5 //true

Explanation
1. int k = ((Integer) t).intValue()/10; Since both the operands of / are ints,
it is a integer division.
This means the resulting value is truncated (and not rounded).
Therefore, the above statement will print 10 and not 11. 5. 3 + 100/10*2-13
will be parsed as: 3 + (100/10)*2-13.

This is because the precedence of / and * is same (and is higher than + and -) and
since the expression is evaluated from left to right, the operands are grouped
on first come first served basis.
[This is not the right terminology but you will be able to answer the questions
if you remember this rule.]
