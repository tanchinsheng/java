What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following code?

The code will fail to compile.

It will print d.

It will print c.

It will print b.

It will print a. //true

Explanation
In the case of i == f, value of i will be promoted to a float i.e. 5.0, and so it returns false.
(int)f+(int)d =  (int)5.5 + (int) 3.8 => 5 + 3 = 8
(int)(f + d) => (int) (5.5 + 3.8) => (int)(9.3) => 9, so this also return false.
So, c is not incremented at all. Hence c remains 'a'.
