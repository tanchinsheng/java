private //correct
Note that the question does not require that 'i' should be accessible from test package. So private is fine.

public 
Marking it public will make it accessible from all classes in all packages.

protected
It will make it available to a subclass even if the subclass is in a different package.

No access modifier //correct

friend
There is no such modifier in Java.
