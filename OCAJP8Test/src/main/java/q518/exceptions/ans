Remove line 3, 6 //true

Remove line 5

Remove line 5, 6 //true

Remove line 7 //true

Remove line 3, 7 //true

Explanation
Basically, an unreachable statement causes a compilation error (There is one exception: if(false) { ... } is valid.).
As such, line 7 is unreachable because of the return statement in finally.
This is because finally is always executed and there it returns a value, so there is no way line 7 can be executed!     

When you remove the lines suggested by the options, all the lines of code are executed in one case or another.
For example, in option 1, if you comment line 3 and 6, Line 7 will be executed if no exception is thrown in the try block.

We suggest you to try working out other scenarios yourself in a similar manner.
