Which line in the following code will cause the compilation to fail?

Line 10

Line 11 //true
//j1 has not been declared at this point.
You cannot use a variable before it is declared.
Note that static and instance fields are always defined before everything else.
So even though x is declared after the work() method, it will be
initialized before the method is actually executed.

Line 12//true
//You cannot assign a double to an int without casting it to int.
For example, int j1 = (int) x; is valid.
but int j1 = (double) (int) x; or int j1 = x; are not valid.

Line 15

Line 19
