What will it print when compiled and run?

5

6

7

8 //true

9

Explanation
The control in the case falls through till reaches the break statement.
Here, switch(4) will take the control to case 4:.
Now since there is no break statement, all the statements till the
will be executed. So j will be incremented 3 time making it 4.
finally 4 + 4 i.e. 8 will be returned.
