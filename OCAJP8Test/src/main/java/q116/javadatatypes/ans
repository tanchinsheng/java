Chaining to use a value of a variable at the time of declaration is not allowed. 
Had b and c been already declared, it would have been valid. 

For example, the following is valid:   
    int  b = 0, c = 0;  
    int a = b = c = 100; 

Even the following is valid:   
    int  b , c;  //Not initializing b and c here.   
    int a = b = c = 100; //declaring a and initializing c, b, and a at the same time. 

Notice the order of initialization of the variables - c is initialized first, 
b is initialized next by assigning to it the value of c. Finally, a is initialized.
