Consider the following directory structure shown in Image 1 that displays available folders and classes and the code given below.

class StockQuote{   
    Stock stock;   
    public StockQuote(Stock s)  {   
    }   
    public double computePrice(){     
        return Helper.getPricer(stock).price();   
    }
}

Assuming that the code uses valid method calls, what statements must be added to the above class?

com.(Helper.class)
com.enthu.(Util.class)
com.enthu.rad.(Stock.class)

import com.enthu.*;
//This is not required because the code is not using any class from this package.

import com.*.*;
//Bad Syntax. You can only import one package (i.e. all classes in that package) using a * or one class in an import statement.

import *.*.*;
//Bad syntax.

import com.*; //true
//This is required because the code is using Helper.class, which exists in com package.

import com.enthu.rad.*; //true
//This is required because the code is using Stock.class, which exists in com.enthu.rad package.

import all;

Explanation
Since the given class does not have any package declaration,
it belongs to the default package and therefore it must import com.Helper and com.enthu.rad.Stock classes.
