//1 will not compile because of lack of throws clause.
//Operations in the new date/time related classes throw java.time.DateTimeException, which extends from RuntimeException.
Therefore, this exception is not required to be caught or declared in the throws clause.

//2 will not compile because of invalid date string.
//The given date string does not contain a time component and so it cannot be parsed by LocalDateTime.
However, this is a run time issue and not a compile time one.

//2 will throw an exception at run time. //true
//It will throw a DateTimeException because it doesn't have time component.
Exception in thread "main" java.time.format.DateTimeParseException: Text '2015-01-01' could not be parsed at index 10.
A String such as 2015-01-01T17:13:50 would have worked.

It will print 2015-01-01T00:00:00

It will print null.
