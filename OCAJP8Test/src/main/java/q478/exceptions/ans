method1 in class NewBase does not need to specify any exceptions. //true

The code will not compile because RuntimeExceptions cannot be specified in the throws clause.
//Any Exception can be specified in the throws clause.

method1 in class NewBase must at least specify IOException in its throws clause.

method1 in class NewBase must at least specify NullpointerException in its throws clause.
//This is not needed because NullPointerException is a RuntimeException.

There is no problem with the code. //true

Explanation
Overriding method only needs to specify a subset of the list of exception classes the overridden method can throw. 
A set of no classes is a valid subset of that list.  
Remember that  NullPointerException is a subclass of RuntimeException, while IOException is a subclass of Exception.
