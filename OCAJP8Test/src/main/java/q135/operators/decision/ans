What is the result of executing the following fragment of code:

boolean b1 = false;
int i1 = 2;
int i2 = 3;
if (b1 = i1 == i2){    
    System.out.println("true");
} else{    
    System.out.println("false");
}

Compile time error.

It will print true

It will print false //true

Runtime error.

It will print nothing.

Explanation
The expression b1 = i1 == i2 will be evaluated as b1 = (i1 == i2)
because == has higher precedence than =.
Further, all an if statement needs is a boolean.
Now i1 == i2 returns false which is a boolean and since b1 = false
is an expression and every expression has a return value
(which is actually the Left Hand Side of the expression),
it returns false which is again a boolean.
Therefore, in this case, the else condition will be executed.
