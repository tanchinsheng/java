What would be the result of compiling and running the following program?

The code will fail to compile, because the int[] array declaration is incorrect.

The program will compile, but will throw an IndexArrayOutOfBoundsException when run.

The program will compile and run without error, and will print nothing.

The program will compile and run without error and will print null ten times.
//Here, all the array elements are initialized to have 0.

The program will compile and run without error and will print 0 ten times.//true
// It correctly will declare and initialize an array of length 10 containing
// int values initialized to have 0.

Explanation
Elements of Arrays of primitive types are initialized to their default value
( i.e. 0 for integral types, 0.0 for float/double and false for boolean)
Elements of Arrays of non-primitive types are initialized to null.
