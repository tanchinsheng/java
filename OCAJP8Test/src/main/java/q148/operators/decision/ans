Which of the following statements are true?

The condition expression in an if statement can contain method calls.//true
//Yes, as long as the method returns a boolean value.

If a and b are of type boolean, the expression (a = b) can be used as
the condition expression of an if statement.//true

An if statement can have either an 'if' clause or an 'else' clause.
//An if-statement must always have an 'if' clause. 'else' is optional.

The statement : if (false) ; else ; is illegal.
//if-clause and the else-clause can have empty statements.
Empty statement ( i.e. just  a semi-colon ) is a valid statement.

Only expressions which evaluate to a boolean value can be used as the
condition in an if statement. //true
//Unlike C/C++ where you can use integers as conditions,
in java, only booleans are allowed.

Explanation
The expression (a = b) does not compare the variables a and b, but rather assigns the value of b to the variable a.
The result of the expression is the value being assigned.
Since a and b are boolean variables, the value returned by the expression is also boolean.
This allows the expressions to be used as the condition for an if-statement.
if-clause and the else-clause can have empty statements.
Empty statement ( i.e. just ; ) is a valid statement.

But this is illegal :
if (true) else;
because the if part doesn't contain any valid statement.
( A statement cannot start with an else!)
So, the following is valid.

if(true) if(false);
because if(false); is a valid statement.
