the value of ANGLE will not be set to 90 by the setAngle method.

An exception will be thrown at run time.

The code will work as expected setting the value of ANGLE to 90.

The code will not compile.

Explanation
The given code has two problems:

1. If you declare a field to be final,
it must be explicitly initialized by the time the creation of an object of the
class is complete.
So you can either initialize it immediately:
private final double ANGLE = 0;
or you can initialize it in the constructor or an instance block.

2. Since ANGLE is final, you can't change its value once it is set.
 Therefore the setAngle method will also not compile.
