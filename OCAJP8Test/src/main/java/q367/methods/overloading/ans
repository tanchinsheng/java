The code will not compile.//true

Explanation
You cannot have more than one method in a class with the same signature.
Method signature includes method name and the argument list but does not include
return type. Therefore, the two getLoad() methods have the same signature and
will not compile.  This shows that method overloading cannot be done on the
basis of the return types.
