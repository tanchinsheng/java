Which of these statements are valid when occurring by themselves in a method?

while ( ) break ;
//The condition expression in a while header is required.

do { break ; } while (true) ;//true

if (true) { break ; } (When not inside a switch block or a loop)
//You cannot have break or continue in an 'if' or 'else' block without being
inside a loop. Note that the problem statement mentions, "...occuring by
themselves". This implies that the given statement is not wrapped within
any other block.

switch (1) { default : break; }
//You can use a constant in switch(...);

for ( ; true ; ) break ;//true

Explanation
//It is not possible to break out of an if statement. But if the if statement
is placed within a switch statement or a loop construct, the usage of break
in option 3 would be valid.
