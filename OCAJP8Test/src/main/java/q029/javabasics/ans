111 333 333 //true

333 333 333

java.lang.NumberFormatException

java.lang.Exception

Compilation fails.

Explanation
Observe that a new local variable named global is defined within a try block.
It is accessible only within the try block. It also shadows the instance field of the same name global within the try block.
It is this variable that is used in parseInt. Therefore, value is set to 333.
However, when you print global in parse method, the global defined in the try block is out of scope and the
instance field named global is used. Therefore, it prints 111.

There is no exception because 333 can be parsed into an int. If you pass a string that cannot be parsed
into an int to the parseInt method, it will throw a java.lang.NumberFormatException.
