The above class needs to protect an invariant on the "area" field.
Which three members must have the public access modifiers removed to ensure that the invariant is maintained?

the base field //true

the height field //true

the area field //true

the Triangle constructor

the setBase method

the setHeight method

Explanation
An invariant means a certain condition that constrains the state stored in the object.
For example, in this case the value of the area field of the Triangle must always be consistent with its base and height fields.
Thus, it should never have a value that is different from base*height/2.

If you allow other classes to directly change the value of base, height, or area, using direct field access,
the area field may not contain the correct area thereby breaking the invariant.

To prevent this inconsistency from happening, you need to prohibit changing the instance fields directly and
instead permit the changes only through the setter method because these methods call the updateArea method and
keep the area and base and height consistent.
