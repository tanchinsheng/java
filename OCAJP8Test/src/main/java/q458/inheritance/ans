Object o = a; Runnable r = o; // nok

Object o = a; Runnable r = (Runnable) o; //ok
//Here you are explicitly telling the compiler that o refers to an object that is Runnable.

Object o = a; Observer ob = (Observer) o; //compile ok, run nok
//It will compile but will fail at run time as at runtime 'a' does not refer to an object which is Observable

Object o = b; Observer o2 = o; //nok

Object o = b; Runnable r = (Runnable) b;  //ok
//Since b is declared of a type that indirectly implements Runnable, 
//the compiler can figure out that b will always point to an object that is assignable to a Runnable. 
//Therefore, explicit cast is not required here. It will still work fine with the explicit cast though.

Explanation
Although o refers to an object which is Runnable but the compiler doesn't know about it. 
You have to do: Runnable r = (Runnable) o; You can assign a subclass object reference to superclass reference 
without a cast but to assign a super class object reference to a subclass (or interface) reference 
you need an explicit cast as in option 2.
