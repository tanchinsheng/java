What will be the output if you run the following program?

0 0 will be printed twice.

1 1 will be printed once.

0 1 will be printed followed by 1 2.

0 0 will be printed followed by 1 1.//true

It will print 0 0 and then 0 1.

Explanation
j will be less than 1 for only the first iteration.
So, first it will print 0, 0. Next, i and j are incremented.   
Because j is not less than 1 at the start of the loop, the condition fails
and it comes out of the loop. Finally, it will print 1,1.
