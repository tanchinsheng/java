Now consider the following 3 options for running the program:
a: java Test
b: java Test param1
c: java Test param1 param2
Which of the following statements are true?

The program will throw java.lang.ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException on option a.

The program will throw java.lang.NullPointerException on option a.

The program will print Test param1 on option b.
//Unlike in C++, Name of the file is not passed in args because for a public class it is always same as the name of the class.

It will print param1 param2 on option c. //true

It will not print anything on option a. //true

Explanation
It will not throw NullPointerException because args[] is never null. 
If no argument is given (as in option a) then the length of args is 0.
