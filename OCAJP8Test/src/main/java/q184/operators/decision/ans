What will the following code print?

1 2 //true

2 3

12 2

12 1

It will not compile

Explanation
This question is based on 2 concepts:

1. i = ++j; is not same as i = j++; In the case of i = ++j, j is first incremented and then compared with i.
While in the case of i = j++;, j is first compared with i and then incremented.

2. The | and & operators, when applied to boolean operands, ensure that both the sides are evaluated.
This is opposed to || and && operators, which do not evaluate the Right Hand Side operand
if the result can be known by just evaluating the Left Hand Side.
Now, let us see the values of i and j at each step:
int i = 0;
int j = 1;
if( (i++ == 0) & (j++ == 2) )    //compare i with 0 and increment i => returns true and i becomes 1. Evaluate next condition:         
//compare j with 2 and increment j => return false and j becomes 2.         
//true & false returns false so i= 12 is not executed.{    
i = 12;
} System.out.println(i+" "+j)); //print 1 and 2
