Consider: o1 and o2 denote two object references to two different objects
of the same class. Which of the following statements are true?

o1.equals(o2) will always be false.
//It depends on how the equals method is overridden.
If it is not overridden, then it will return false.

o1.hashCode() == o2.hashCode() will always be false.
//hashCode() can be overridden and so the given statements is not true.

o1 == o2 will always be false.//true
//The == operator compares whether the two references are pointing to the same
// object or not. Here, they are not, so it returns false.

Nothing can be said about o1.equals(o2) regarding what it will return based
on the given information.//true
//It depends on how the class implements this method.

Nothing can be said about o1 == o2.
//It will always return false if references are to two different objects.

Explanation
Note that both equals() and hashCode() methods can be overridden by the
programmer so you can't say anything about what they will return without
looking at the code.
