Java's Exception mechanism helps in which of the following ways?

It allows creation of new exceptions that are custom to a particular application domain. //true
//You can define your own exceptions based of your application business domain.
//For example, in a banking application, you might want to create a InsufficientFundsException.
//This increases code clarity as compared to having a single (or a few standard) exception class(es) and
//looking at the exception code to determine what happened.


It improves code because error handling code is clearly separated from the main program logic. //true
//The error handling logic is put in the catch block, which makes the main flow of the program clean and easily understandable.


It enhances the security of the application by reporting errors in the logs.
//Exception handling as such has nothing to do with the security of the application but good exception
//handling in an application can prevent security holes.


It improves the code because the exception is handled right at the place where it occured.
//Just the opposite is true. It improves the code because the code does not have to include error handling code
//if it is not capable of handling it. It can propagate the exception up the chain and it can be handled at a
//somewhere at a more appropriate place.


It provides a vast set of standard exceptions that covers all possible exceptions.
//Although it does provide a vast set of standard exceptions, they cannot cover all scenarios.
//But you can always create new exceptions tailored for your application.
