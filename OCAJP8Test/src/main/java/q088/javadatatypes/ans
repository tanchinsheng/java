What can be done to make this code compile and run?

replace // LINE 2 with:
private int side = 0;

replace // LINE 2 with:
public int side = 0;

replace // LINE 5 with:
double sq = new Square();

replace // LINE 6 with:
sq.side = 10;
//side is not a global variable that you can access directly
(Note that Java doesn't have the concept of a global variable).
side is a field in Square class. So you need to specify which
Square object's side you are trying to access.
An integer can be assigned to a double but not vice versa.
