Identify the valid for loop constructs assuming the following declarations:

Object o = null;
Collection c = //valid collection object.
int[][] ia = //valid array

for(o : c){ }
//Cannot use an existing/predefined variable in the variable declaration part.

for(final Object o2 :c){ } //true
//final is the only modifier (excluding annotations) that is allowed here.

for(int i : ia) { }
//Each element of ia is itself an array. Thus, they cannot be assigned to an int.

for(Iterator it : c.iterator()){ }
//c.iterator() does not return any Collection. Note that the following would have
been valid: Collection<Iterator> c = //some collection that contains Iterator
objects for(Iterator it : c){ }

for(int i : ia[0]){ }//true
Since ia[0] is an array of ints, this is valid. (It may throw a NullPointerException
or ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime if ia is not appropriately initialized.)
