Which of the following can be valid declarations of an integer variable?

global int x = 10;
//global is an invalid modifier. There is nothing like global in java.
The closest you can get is static.

final int x = 10; //true

public Int x = 10;
//Int with a capital I is invalid.

Int x = 10;
//Int with a capital I is invalid.

static int x = 10; //true
