Which of the following are valid classes?

public class ImaginaryNumber extends Number { //true
//implementation for abstract methods of the base class
}
//Number is not a final class so you can extend it.

public class ThreeWayBoolean extends Boolean {
//implementation for abstract methods of the base class
}

public class NewSystem extends System {
//implementation for abstract methods of the base class
}

public class ReverseString extends String {
//implementation for abstract methods of the base class
}

Explanation
String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer - all are final classes.

1. Remember that wrapper classes for primitives (java.lang.Boolean,
java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long, java.lang.Short etc.) are also final and so
they cannot be extended.

2. java.lang.Number, however, is not final. Integer, Long, Double etc. extend Number.

3. java.lang.System is final as well.
