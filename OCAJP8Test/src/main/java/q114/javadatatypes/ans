What will it print when run?

It will print 0.

It will not print 0. //true

It will not compile.

It will throw an exception at runtime.

None of the above.

Explanation
Actually it prints -46. This is because the information was lost during
the conversion from type int to type float as values of type float are not
precise to nine significant digits. Note: You are not required to know the
number of significant digits that can be stored by a float for the exam.
However, it is good to know about loss of precision while using float and double.
