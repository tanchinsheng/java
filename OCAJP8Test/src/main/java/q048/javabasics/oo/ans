There are no member variables.

Member fields are declared private and public accessor/mutator methods are provided to access and change their values if needed.//true

Explanation
Encapsulation is one of the 4 fundamentals of OOP (Object Oriented Programming).

Encapsulation means that the internal representation of an object is generally hidden from view outside of the object's definition.
Typically, only the object's own methods can directly inspect or manipulate its fields.
Some languages like Smalltalk and Ruby only allow access via object methods,
but most others (e.g. C++ or Java) offer the programmer a degree of control over what is hidden,
typically via keywords like public and private.

Hiding the internals of the object protects its integrity by preventing users from setting the internal
data of the component into an invalid or inconsistent state.
A benefit of encapsulation is that it can reduce system complexity, and thus increases robustness,
by allowing the developer to limit the interdependencies between software components.
