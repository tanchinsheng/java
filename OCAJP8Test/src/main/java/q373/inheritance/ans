Explanation
Even though class Klass implements m1(), it does not declare that it implements I
Therefore, for a subclass to 'implement' I, it must have 'implements I' in
its declaration. Further, m1() in Klass is not public. So even though Subclass
inherits m1() from Klass, it will not be a valid implementation of I because
interface methods must be public. Therefore, SubClass must override m1() and
make it public.
