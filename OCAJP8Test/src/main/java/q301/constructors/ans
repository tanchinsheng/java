What will be the result of attempting to compile the following program?

A compilation error will be encountered at (1), since constructors should not
specify a return value.
//But it becomes a valid method if you give a return type.

A compilation error will be encountered at (2), since the class does not have
a default constructor.
//The class has an implicit default constructor since the class doesn't have
any constructor defined.

A compilation error will be encountered at (3).
//Because (1) is a method and not a constructor.
So there is no constructor that take a parameter.

The program will compile correctly.

It will not compile because parameter type of the constructor is different
than the type of value passed to it.
//If (1) was a valid constructor 'int' would be promoted to long at the time of passing.

Explanation
The declaration at (1) declares a method, not a constructor because it has a return value.
The method happens to have the same name as the class, but that is ok.
The class has an implicit default constructor since the class contains
no constructor declarations. This allows the instantiation at (2) to work.
