f is a Bird 
e is a Flyer

At run time, f points to an object of class Eagle. Now, Eagle extends Bird so f instanceof Bird returns true. 
e points to an object of class Eagle. Eagle extends Bird, which in turn implements Flyer. So an Eagle is a Flyer. 
Therefore, e instanceof Flyer will also return true.  b points to an object of class Bat, which does not extend from Bird. 
Therefore, b instanceof Flyer returns false.

Explanation
Note that there is no compilation issue with b instanceof Flyer because Flyer is an interface and 
it is possible for b to point to an object of a class that is a sub class of Bat and also implements Flyer. 
So the compiler doesn't complain. If you make Bat class as final, b instanceof Flyer will not compile 
because the compiler knows that it is not possible for b to point to an object of a class that implements Flyer.
