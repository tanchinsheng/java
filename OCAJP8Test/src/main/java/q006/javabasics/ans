A valid declaration of "the" main() method must be public and static, should return void,
and should take a single array of Strings as a parameter.

The order of the static and public keywords is irrelevant.
But the return type should always come just before the method name.

Applying final to the method does not change the method signature.

In some versions of JDK, even a private or protected main() method works from command line.
However, for the purpose of Java Certification exam, it should be assumed that for the JVM to
execute a class using the standard main method, the accessibility of the main method must be public.
