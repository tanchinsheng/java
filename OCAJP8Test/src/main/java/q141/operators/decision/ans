What will be the output when the following class is compiled and run?

It will not compile because line //1 cannot be parsed correctly.

It will not compile because x is used before initialization.
// It is not.

It will not compile because there is an ambiguous reference to x.
//There is no conflict for resolution of x.
The local 'x' simply shadows the member variable 'x'.

It will print 12. //true

It will print 3 .

Explanation
x is first initialized by x = 3, then the value of this expression (i.e. "x = 3"),
which is 3, is multiplied by 4 and is again assigned to x. So it prints 12.
