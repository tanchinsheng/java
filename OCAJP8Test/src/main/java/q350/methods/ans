To call someMethod(Object parameter), you must pass exactly one parameter. 
So someMethod() is not a valid call to this method and the code will not compile. 
Note that parameter will not be assigned a null or default value.  
However, if the method were declared to take variable number of arguments, 
it would have been valid to call it without any parameters. 

For example:     
 
public static void someMethod(Object... params){         
System.out.println(params.length);     
}  

In this case, calling someMethod() without any parameter will print 0. 
i.e. the length of params array will be 0. params will NOT be null.
