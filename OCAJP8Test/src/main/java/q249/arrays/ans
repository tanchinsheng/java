What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following class?

The code will print i = 1 iArr[0] = 1

The code will print i = 1 iArr[0] = 2//true

The code will print i = 2 iArr[0] = 1

The code will print i = 2 iArr[0] = 2

The code will not compile.
//There is no problem with the code.

Explanation
Arrays are proper objects (i.e. iArr instanceof Object returns true)
and Object references are passed by value (so effectively, it seems as though
objects are being passed by reference). So the value of reference of iArr
is passed to the method incr(int[] i); This method changes the actual value
of the int element at 0.
