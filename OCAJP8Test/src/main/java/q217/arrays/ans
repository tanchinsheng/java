What will the following code snippet print?

nothing

null //true

It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBounds at runtime.

It will print some junk value.

None of the above.

Explanation
When you create an array of Objects ( here, Strings) all the elements are
initialized to null. So in the line 3, null is assigned to myStr.
Note that. empty string is "" ( String str = ""; ) and is not same as null.
