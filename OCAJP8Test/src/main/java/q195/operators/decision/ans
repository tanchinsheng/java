 What changes can be done so that it will print only true?

No change is necessary.
//You cannot use a boolean expression in a switch statement and for case statements.
So, as it is, the given code will not compile.

Call getString instead of getBool in the switch.

Call getString instead of getBool in the switch and also change the
case label from true to "true". //true
//Strings can be used in a switch.

Remove the default section of the switch block.
//Since there is a break; statement in the previous case block,
there is no need to remove the default section. It will not execute anyway.
