What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?

It will not compile.

It will go in infinite loop when run.

The program will write 10 to the standard output.

The program will write 0 to the standard output.//true

None of the above.

Explanation
This is just a simple code that is meant to confuse you.
Notice the for statement: for(int i=10; i<0; i--). i is being initialized
to 10 and the test is i<0, which is false. Therefore, the control will
never get inside the for loop, none of the weird code will be executed,
and x will remain 0, which is what is printed.
