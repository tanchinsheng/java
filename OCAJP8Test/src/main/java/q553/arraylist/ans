Explanation
ArrayList's remove(Object ) method removes the first occurence of the given element and returns true if found.
It does not remove all occurences of the element. In this case, the first call to s1.remove("a");
will remove only the first "a" and return true, the second call to remove("a") will remove the second "a" and return true.
Finally, the call to remove("b") will remove "b". Therefore, only "c" will be left in the list.

The JavaDoc API description of this method is important for the exam - 

public boolean remove(Object o)
Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present (optional operation).
If this list does not contain the element, it is unchanged.
More formally, removes the element with the lowest index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i)))
(if such an element exists). Returns true if this list contained the specified element
(or equivalently, if this list changed as a result of the call).
