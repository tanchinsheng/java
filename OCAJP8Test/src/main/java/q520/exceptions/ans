add throws IOException to the main method.

add throws IOException to PortConnector constructor.

Change RuntimeException to java.io.IOException.

add throws Exception to PortConnector constructor and change catch(RuntimeException re)
to catch(Exception re) in the main method. // true

Explanation


IOException is a checked exception and since the PortConnector constructor throws IOException,
this exception (or its superclass) must be present in the throws clause of the constructor.
Now, the main method has two options, either catch IOException (or whatever exception PortConnector throws)
in its catch block (i.e. option 5) or put that exception in its throws clause (i.e. option 3).
