Which of the following is/are valid instantiations and initializations of
a multi dimensional array?

int[][] array2D = new int[][] { { 0, 1, 2, 4} {5, 6}};
//It is missing a comma between 4} and {5.
It should be: new int[][] { { 0, 1, 2, 4} , {5, 6}};

int[][][] array3D = {{0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5}};
//The right side has only two dimensions while the left has three.
It should be:
int [] [] [] array3D = { { {0, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 5} } };

int[] array2D[] = new int [2] [2];
array2D[0] [0] = 1;
array2D[0] [1] = 2;
array2D[1] [0] = 3; //true
//Notice that element [1][1] is not given a value explicitly in the code.
It is given a default value of 0 automatically.

int[][] array2D = new int[][]{0, 1};
//The right side has only one dimension while the left has two.
It should be: int [] [] array2D = new int[][]{ {0}, {1}};

int[] arr = {1, 2};
int[][] arr2 = {arr, {1, 2}, arr};
int[][][] arr3 = {arr2}; //true
