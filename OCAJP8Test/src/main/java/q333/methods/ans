What will the following code print when compiled and run?

0 10

10 10//true

10 0

5 5

0 5

5 0

Explanation
The field a is static and there will be only one copy of a no matter how many
instances of Test you create. Changes made to it by one instance will be reflected
in the other instance as well. But field b is an instance field. Each instance of
Test will get its on copy of b.  Therefore, when you call p1.foo() and then p2.foo(),
the same field a is incremented 5 times twice and so it will print 10 10.
