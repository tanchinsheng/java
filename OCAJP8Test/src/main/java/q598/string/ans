How can you initialize a StringBuilder to have a capacity of at least 100 characters?

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(100);//true
//public StringBuilder(int capacity)
Constructs a string builder with no characters in it and an initial capacity specified by the capacity argument.

StringBuilder sb = StringBuilder.getInstance(100);

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.setCapacity(100);
//There is no setCapacity method in StringBuilder.

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.ensureCapacity(100);//true
//public void ensureCapacity(int minimumCapacity)
Ensures that the capacity is at least equal to the specified minimum. If the current capacity is less than the argument,
then a new internal array is allocated with greater capacity. The new capacity is the larger of:
The minimumCapacity argument.
Twice the old capacity, plus 2.

If the minimumCapacity argument is nonpositive, this method takes no action and simply returns.

Explanation
Observe that the question says "at least 100 characters". In the exam, you may get a question that says "100 characters",
in that case, ensureCapacity() may not be a valid option.
