What will be printed?

In float 3.0

In double 3.0

In double 3

It will not compile.

Explanation
The call to printSum(1.0, 2.0) will be bound to printSum(double, double )
because 1.0 and 2.0 are double, which are exact match to double, double.
Note that if you call printSum(1, 2) , printSum(float, float) would have
been invoked instead of printSum(double, double) because a float is closer
than a double to an int.  We advise you to run this program and try out
various combinations. The exam has questions on this pattern.
