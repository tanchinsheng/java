1. Arrays are indexed from 0. 
2. In java, the name of the class is not the first element of args. 

So, when the command line is : java TestClass 1 2, args[0] is 1 and args[1] is 2. 
When you try to access args[2], It will throw an ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException because 
the array length is only 2 so args[2] is out of bounds.
