Which of the following statements are true?

As such, the class will compile and print "20 "
(without quotes) at the end of its output.//true

It will not compile if line 3 is removed.//true

It will not compile if line 3 is removed and placed before line 1.//true

It will not compile if line 4 is removed and placed before line 3.//true

Only Option 2, 3, and 4 are correct.

Explanation
The scope of a local variable declared in 'for' statement is the rest of the
'for' statement, including its own initializer. So, when line 3 is placed
before line 1, there is a redeclaration of i in the first for() which is not legal.
As such, the scope of i's declared in for() is just within the 'for' blocks.
So placing line 4 before line 3 will not work since 'i' is not in scope there.
