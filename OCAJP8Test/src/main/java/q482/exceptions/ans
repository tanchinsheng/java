Compilation error at line 1 as this is an invalid syntax for defining a label.
//You can apply a label to any code block or a block level statement (such as a for statement) but not to declarations. 
For example: loopX : int i = 10;

Compilation error at line 2 as 'loop' is not visible here.

No compilation error and line 3 will be executed.
//Even if the break takes the control out of the block, the finally clause will be executed.

No compilation error and line 3 will NOT be executed.

Only the line with the label loop will be printed.

Explanation
A break without a label breaks the current loop (i.e. no iterations any more) and a break with a label 
tries to pass the control to the given label. 'Tries to' means that if the break is in a try block and the 
try block has a finally clause associated with it then it will be executed.
