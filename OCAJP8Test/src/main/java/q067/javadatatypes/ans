Note: Although Wrapper classes are not explicitly mentioned in the exam objectives,
we have seen some candidates get questions on this aspect of Wrapper classes.

What will be the output of the following program?

equal

not equal //true

Compile time error at //1

Runtime error at //1

None of the above.

Explanation
Signature of equals method is : boolean equals(Object o);
So it can take any object.
The equals methods of all wrapper classes first check if the two object
are of same class or not. If not, they immediately return false.
Hence it will print not equal.
