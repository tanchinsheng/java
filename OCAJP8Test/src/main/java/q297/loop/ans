Which of the following will produce the same result?

for(int i=INT1; i<INT2; System.out.println(++i));
//Prints: 2 and 3

for(int i=INT1; i++<INT2; System.out.println(i));
//Prints: 2 and 3

int i=INT1; while(i++<INT2) { System.out.println(i); }
//Prints: 2 and 3

int i=INT1; do { System.out.println(i); }while(i++<INT2);
//Prints: 1 2 and 3

None of these.

Explanation
In such a question it is best to take a sample data such as INT1=1 and INT2=3
and execute the loops mentally.
Eliminate the wrong options. In this case, the original loop will print:
=====ORIGINAL ====
1

2

Outputs of all the options are given above (Ignoring the line breaks).

Thus, none of them is same as the original.
