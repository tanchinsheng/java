Which of the following operators can be used in conjunction with a String object?

+ //true

++

+= //true

. //true

*

Explanation
Only + is overloaded for String. a+=x is actually converted to a = a + x. so it is valid for Strings.
dot (.) operator accesses members of the String object. There is only one member variable though: CASE_INSENSITIVE_ORDER.
It is of type Comparator (which is an interface).
