What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

T3 cannot implement both T1 and T2 because it leads to ambiguity.

There is nothing wrong with the code.//true

The code will work fine only if VALUE is removed from T2 interface.

The code will work fine only if m1() is removed from either T2 and T3.

None of the above.

Explanation
Having ambiguous fields or methods does not cause any problem by itself but
referring to such fields or methods in an ambiguous way will cause a compile
time error. T3.m1() is also fine because even though m1() is declared in T2
as well as T3 , the definition to both resolves unambiguously to only one m1().
Explicit cast is not required for calling the method m1() : ( ( T2) t).m1();
m1(int x) is valid because it is a totally independent method declared by T3.
