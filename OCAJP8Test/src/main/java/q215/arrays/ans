1 and 3 declare a two dimensional array alright but they create the array of size 2, 3. 
And cA[2][3] means we need an array of size 3, 4 because the numbering starts from 0.

4 : You cannot put array size information on left hand side of equals sign.

5 : This is a one dimensional array and that too of strings. 

Note that a java String is not equivalent to 1 dimensional array of chars.
This leaves us with only one choice 2.
