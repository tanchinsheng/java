This is a simple while loop nested inside a for loop. The for loop loops three times - once for each value in values array. 
Since, values.length is 3, x is incremented two times for each for loop iteration before the condition x<values.length returns false. 
Therefore, it prints: 
0 10 
1 10 
2 10 
0 30 
1 30 
2 30 
0 50 
1 50 
2 50
