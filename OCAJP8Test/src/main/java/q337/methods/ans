What will the following code print when run?

test

new test

It will not compile.//true
//There is no method named print() defined in class A.
Further, there is no such method in class Object either.
To print the contents of an object you can use toString()
method that returns a String: System.out.println(a.toString());
However, for this to print a meaningful value, class A should
override the Object class's toString() method to return a meaningful String.

It will throw an exception at run time.
