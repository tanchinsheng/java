Syntax of try/catch/finally is:

try{
}
catch(Exception1 e) {... }
catch(Exception2 e) {... }
... catch(ExceptionN e) {... }
finally { ...  }
With a try, either a catch and or finally or both can occur.
A try MUST be followed by at least one catch or finally. (Unless it is a try with resources statement,
which is not in scope for this exam.)

In Java 7, you can collapse the catch blocks into a single one:

try {        
...
} catch (SQLException | IOException | RuntimeException e) {        

//In this block, the class of the actual exception object will be whatever exception is thrown at runtime.   
//But the class of the reference e will be the closest common super class of all the exceptions in the catch block.   
//In this case, it will be java.lang.Exception because that is the most specific class that is a
//super class for all the three exceptions.   e.printStackTrace(); }
