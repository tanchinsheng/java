What is the result?

It will not compile.
//There is no problem with the code. The variable j declared in the for loop
shadows the instance member j inside the for loop.

It will print 1 2 3 4 5 five times.

It will print 1 3 5 five times.

It will print 1 2 3 4 5 once.

It will print 1 2 3 4 5 six times.//true

Explanation
The point to note here is that the j in for loop is different from the instance
 member j. Therefore, j++ occuring in the for loop doesn't affect the while loop.
The for loop prints 1 2 3 4 5.
The while loop runs for the values 0 to 5 i.e. 6 iterations.
Thus, 1 2 3 4 5 is printed 6 times. Note that after the end of the while
loop the value of j is 6.
