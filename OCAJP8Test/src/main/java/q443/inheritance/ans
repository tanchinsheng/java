Explanation
Fields defined in an interface are ALWAYS considered as public, static, and final.
Even if you don't explicitly define them as such.
In fact, you cannot even declare a field to be private or protected in an interface.
Therefore, you cannot assign any value to 'type' outside the interface definition.
