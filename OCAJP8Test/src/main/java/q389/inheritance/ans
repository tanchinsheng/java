Which of the following methods can be inserted in class Y?

public C getB(){ return new B(); } // Wrong
Its return type is specified as C, but it is actually returning an object of type B. Since B is NOT a C, this will not compile.

protected B getB(){ return new C(); } // Correct
Since C is-a B, this is valid. Also, an overriding method can be made less restrictive.
protected is less restrictive than 'default' access.

C getB(){ return new C(); }// Correct
Covariant returns are allowed in Java 1.5, which means that an overriding method can change the return type of the
overridden method to a subclass of the original return type. Here, C is a subclass of B. So this is valid.

A getB(){ return new A(); } // Wrong
An overriding method cannot return a superclass object of the return type defined in the overridden method.
A subclass is allowed in Java 1.5.
