What will the following program print?

111 //true

222

It will not compile as bA[0] is uninitialized

It will throw an exception at runtime.

None of the above.

Explanation
All the arrays are initialized to contain the default values of their type.
This means, int[] iA = new int[10]; will contain 10 integers with a value of 0.
Object[] oA = new Object[10]; will contain 10 object references pointing to null.
boolean[] bA = new boolean[10] will contain 10 booleans of value false.
So, as bA[0] is false, the if condition fails and str remains 111.
