What would be the result of attempting to compile and run the following code?

The code will fail to compile.

Runtime error.

The code will compile without errors and will print 80 when run.//true

The code will compile without errors and will print 40 when run.

The code will compile without errors and will print 20 when run.

Explanation
When the program is run, the main() method will call the max() method in C with
parameters 10 and 20 because the actual object referenced by 'c' is of class C.
This method will call the max() method in B with the parameters 20 and 40.
The max() method in B will in turn call the max() method in A with the
parameters 20 and 40. The max() method in A will return 40 to the max()
 method in B. The max() method in B will return 80 to the max() method in C.
And finally the max() of C will return 80 in main() which will be printed out.
