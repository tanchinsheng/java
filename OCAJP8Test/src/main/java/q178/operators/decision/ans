1. Defining i as char doesn't mean that it can only hold characters (a, b, c etc). 
It is an integral data type which can take any +ive integer value from 0 to 2^16 -1.

2. Integer 0 or 1, 2 etc. is not same as char '0', '1' or '2' etc.
so when i is equal to 0, nothing gets printed and i is incremented to 1 (due to i++ in the switch).
 i is then incremented again by the for loop for next iteration. so i becomes 2.
when i = 2, "C" is printed and i is incremented to 3 (due to i++ in the switch) and 
then i is incremented to 4 by the for loop so i becomes 4.
when i = 4, "E" is printed and since there is no break, it falls through to case '5' and "F" is printed.
i is incremented to 5  (due to i++ in the switch) and then it is again incremented to 6 by the for loop.
 Since i < 5 is now false, the for loop ends.
