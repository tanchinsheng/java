Which code fragments will print the last argument given on the command line
to the standard output, and exit without any output or exception stack trace
if no arguments are given?

1 //true

2 //true

3 //true

4
//if there is only one argument, i will be 1-1 = 0. And the if condition will fail.

5

Explanation
If no argument is given, a String array of length Zero is received in
the main method. So, there is no NullPointerException on accessing
args even if no argument is given.
Indexing in java starts from zero. So the last element will be at args.length-1.
