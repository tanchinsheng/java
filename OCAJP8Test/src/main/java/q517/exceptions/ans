Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Exception: Some Exception
	at q517.exceptions.Test.m1(Test.java:19)
	at q517.exceptions.Test.main(Test.java:24)

Explanation
A NullPointerException never occurs because the index expression must be completely evaluated before any part of
the indexing operation occurs, and that includes the check as to whether the value of the left-hand operand is null.

If the array reference expression produces null instead of a reference to an array,
then a NullPointerException is thrown at runtime, but only after all parts of the array reference
expression have been evaluated and only if these evaluations completed normally.

In an array access, the expression to the left of the brackets appears to be fully evaluated
before any part of the expression within the brackets is evaluated.

Note that if evaluation of the expression to the left of the brackets completes abruptly, no part of the expression within the
brackets will appear to have been evaluated.  Here, m1() is called first, which throws Exception and
so a is never accessed and NullPointerException is never thrown.
