Explanation
Note that for is a keyword and so cannot be used as a label.
But you can use any other identifier as a label.

For example, The following code is valid even though String is a class name and String is also used as an identifier!
     String String = "";   //This is valid.
     String : for(int i = 0; i< 10; i++) //This is valid too!
     {
        for (int j = 0; j< 10; j++){
             if ( i+ j > 10 )  break String;
        }
       System.out.println( "hello");
      }

It will print hello 2 times.
