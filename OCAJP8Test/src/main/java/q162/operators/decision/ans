Which line, if any, will give a compile time error ?

Line 1 as 'a' is not compatible with byte.
//int value of 'a' can easily fit into a byte.

Line 2 as 256 cannot fit into a byte.//true
No compile time error but a run time error at line 2.

No compile time error but a run time error at line 2.

Line 4 as the default label must be the last label in the switch statement.
//Any order of case statements is valid.

There is nothing wrong with the code.

Explanation
Every case constant expression in a switch block must be assignable to the
type of switch expression. Meaning :
byte by = 10;
switch(by){
     case 300 :  //some code;
     case 56 :   //some code;
}
This will not compile as 300 is not assignable to 'by ' which can only
hold values from -128 to 127.
This gives compile time error as the compiler detects it while compiling.
The use of break keyword is not mandatory, and without it the control will
simply fall through the labels of the switch statement.
