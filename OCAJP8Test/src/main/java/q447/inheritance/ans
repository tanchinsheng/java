Which of the following method definitions will prevent overriding of that method?

public final void m1()
//final methods cannot be overridden. That is the purpose of final keyword.

public static void m1()

public static final void m1()
//Keep in mind that static methods are not overridden, they are shadowed.

public abstract void m1()

private void m1()
//private methods are not inherited at all so there is no question of overriding a private method.
