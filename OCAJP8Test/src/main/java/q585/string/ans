What will the following statement return?

"    hello java guru   ".trim();

The line of code will not compile.
//"    hello java guru   " is a valid String and trim() is a valid method in String class.

"hellojavaguru"
//trim() does not remove spaces in within the string but the spaces at the beginning and at the end.

"hello java guru"

"hello java guru   "
//It returns a string in which both the leading and trailing white space of the original string are removed.

None of the above
