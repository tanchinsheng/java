Which of the following access control keywords can be used to enable all
the subclasses to access a method defined in the base class?

public//true
//It will allow everybody to access the method.

private
//It will not allow any other class to access the method.

protected//true
//It will allow the subclasses (in any package) and all the classes in same
package to access the method.

No keyword is needed.
//It will allow only the classes in same package to access the method.
So Subclasses outside the package will not have access.
