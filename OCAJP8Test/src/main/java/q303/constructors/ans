Which lines contain a valid constructor in the following code?

Line // 1 //true

Line // 2
//Constructors cannot return anything. Not even void.

Line // 3
//Constructors cannot have empty bodies (i.e. they cannot be abstract)

Line // 4
//You can apply public, private, protected to a constructor.
But not static, final, synchronized, native and abstract.

Line // 5
//The compiler ignores the extra semi-colon.

Explanation
It is interesting to note that public void TestClass(int a) {}
// 2 will actually compile. It is not a constructor,
but compiler considers it as a valid method!
