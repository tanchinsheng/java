Which of the following statements are acceptable?

Object o = new java.io.File("a.txt");
(Assume that java.io.File is a valid class with a constructor that takes a String.)
//This is valid because every object in Java is an Object.

Boolean bool = false;
//bool is a variable of type Boolean and not of a primitive type boolean
however this is still valid because Java performs auto-boxing (and unboxing)
for primitives and their wrapper types which allows false to be automatically
be boxed into a Boolean false object.

char ch = 10;
//Because 10 can fit into a char.

Thread t = new Runnable();
Assume that Runnable is a valid interface.)
//Since Runnable is an interface, it cannot be instantiated like this. But you can do :
Runnable r = new Runnable(){                        
    public void run(){ }                     
};

Runnable r = new Thread();
(Assume that Thread is a class that implements Runnable interface)
//Since Thread implements Runnable, this is a valid assignment.
