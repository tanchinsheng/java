A continue statement can occur in and only in a for, while or do-while loop. 
A continue statement means: Forget about the rest of the statements in the loop and start the next iteration. 
So, 
for (i=1 ;  i<5  ; i++) continue; just increments the value of i up to 5 because of i++.  
for (i=0 ;       ; i++) break; iterates only once because of the break so the value of i becomes 0.  
for (    ; i<5?false:true ;    ); never iterates because i is less than 5 
(it is 0 because of //2) and the condition expression is false!  
At the end of the code, the value of i is 0.
