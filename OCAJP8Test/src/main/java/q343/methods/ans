Given the following definition of class, which member variables are accessible
from OUTSIDE the package com.enthu.qb?

Member variable i.
//No modifier means package( or default access) and is only accessible
inside the package.

Member variable j.//true
public things (classes, methods and fields) are accessible from anywhere.

Member variable k.
//Only if the accessing class is a subclass of TestClass.

Member variable k, but only for subclasses.//true
protected things (methods and fields) can be accessed from within the package
and from subclasses

Member variable l.
//private things are accessible only from the class that has it.

Explanation
public > protected > package (i.e. no modifier) > private
where public is least restrictive and private is most restrictive.

Remember:
protected is less restrictive than package access.
So a method(or field) declared as protected will be accessible from a subclass
even if the subclass is not in the same package.
The same is not true for package access.
A top level class can only have either public or no access modifier but a method
or field can have all the four.
Note that static, final, native and synchronized are not considered as access modifiers.
