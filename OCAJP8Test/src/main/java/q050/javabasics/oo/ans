Which of the following are features of Java?
(Some candidates have reported a similar question being asked with a slightly different (and ambiguous) wording -
Which of the following are objected oriented features of Java?

Object is the root class of all the classes. //true

Objects cannot be reused.
//Not sure what "reuse" really means here but our guess is that it is incorrect.
One can certainly call methods on the same object again and again.
One can also keep a reference to an object as long as needed.

Objects can share behavoir with other objects.  //true
//Another very vague statement but it is probably true because two objects of two different classes may share
some behavior if the two classes inherit from the same super class.

Everything in Java is an Object.
//This is not  true because Java does have primitives as well (byte, short, char, int, long, float, double, boolean),
which are not Objects.
