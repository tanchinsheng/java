To call myMethod(int m, Object p, double d), you must pass exactly three parameters. 
If you try to pass less (or more) number of parameters, the code will not compile. 
Note that method parameters are not assigned default values.  

It is possible to declare a method that can take variable number of parameters. 
For example:  public static void someMethod(Object... params){         
    System.out.println(params.length);    
}  

You can call this method by passing any number of parameters. 
In this case, calling someMethod() without any parameter will print 0. 
i.e. the length of params array will be 0. params will NOT be null.
