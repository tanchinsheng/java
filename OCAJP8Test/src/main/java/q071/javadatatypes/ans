Identify the valid code fragments when occurring by themselves with in a method.

long y = 123_456_L;
//An underscore can only occur in between two digits. So the _ before L is invalid.

long z = _123_456L;
//An underscore can only occur in between two digits.
So the _ before 1 is invalid. _123_456L is a valid variable name though.
So the following code is valid: int _123_456L = 10; long z = _123_456L;

float f1 = 123_.345_667F;
//An underscore can only occur in between two digits. So the _ before . is invalid.

float f2 = 123_345_667F; //true

None of the above declarations are valid.

Explanation
You may use underscore for all kinds of numbers including long,
double, float, binary, as well as hex.  
For example, the following are all valid numbers -
int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE;
float f = 9898_7878.333_333f;
int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;
