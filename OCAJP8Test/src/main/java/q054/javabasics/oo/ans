You are assigned the task of refactoring the Square class to make it better
in terms of encapsulation. What changes will you make to this class?

Add a calculateArea method:  //true
private void calculateArea(){   
    this.area = this.side*this.side;
}

Make side and area fields private.  //true

Change setSide method to:   //true
public void setSide(double d){
    this.side = d;
    calculateArea();
}

Make the getArea method public.  //true

Add a setArea() method:
public void setArea(double d){ area = d; }
//This is not required because area is calculated using the side.
So if you allow other classes to set the area, it could make side
and area inconsistent with each other.

Explanation
There can be multiple ways to accomplish this.
The exam asks you questions on the similar pattern.
The key is that your data variable should be private and the
functionality that is to be exposed outside should be public.
Further, your setter methods should be coded such that they don't
leave the data members inconsistent with each other.
