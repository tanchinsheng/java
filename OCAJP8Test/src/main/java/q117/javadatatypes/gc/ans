Which is the earliest line in the following code after which the object
created on line // 1 can be garbage collected, assuming no compiler
optimizations are done?

Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6 //true
//Before this line the object is being pointed to by at least one variable.

Explanation
The official exam objectives now explicitly mention Garbage collection.  
All you need to know is:

1. An object can be made eligible for garbage collection by making
sure there are no references pointing to that object.
2. You cannot directly invoke the garbage collector.
You can suggest the JVM to perform garbage collection by calling System.gc();
