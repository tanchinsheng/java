++i < 5 means, increment the value of i and then compare with 5. 
Now, Try to work out the values of i and j at every iteration. To start with, i=0 and j=11. 
At the time of evaluation of the while condition, i and j are as follows:
j = 10 and i=1 (loop will continue because i<5) (Remember that comparison will happen AFTER increment i because it is ++i and not i++.
j = 9 and i=2 (loop will continue because i<5).
j = 8 and i=3 (loop will continue because i<5).
j = 7 and i=4 (loop will continue because i<5).
j = 6 and i=5 (loop will NOT continue because i not <5).
So it will print 5 6. (It is print i first and then j).
