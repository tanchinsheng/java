Which of the following statements are true?

It will not compile.

It will throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at Runtime.

It will throw a NullPointerException at Runtime.

It will compile and run without throwing any exceptions.

None of the above.

Explanation
It will throw a NullPointerException for ia[1][0] because ia[1] is null.
Note that null is not same as having less number of elements in an array than expected.
If you try to access ia[2][0], it would have thrown ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
because the length of ia is only 2 and so ia[2] tries to access an element
out of that range. ia[2] is not null, it simply does not exist.
