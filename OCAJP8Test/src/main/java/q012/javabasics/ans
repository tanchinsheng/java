import java.lang.*;//true
Although this package is automatically imported, it is not an error to import it explicitly.

package p.util;//true
It is a perfectly valid package statement.

public class MyClass{ }
//There can be only 1 "public" class within package scope in a file.
You can have additional inner classes that are public though.

abstract class MyClass{ }
//You can have more than one classes in a file but at most one of them can be public.

Explanation
To make a class abstract, you only need to mark it abstract as shown in Option 4.
You don't necessarily need to put an abstract method in a class.
