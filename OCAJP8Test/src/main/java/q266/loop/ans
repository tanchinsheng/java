What will the following program print?

0 3

0 2

3 0

3 3 //true

2 2

Explanation
The statement:  if(i < j) continue X1; else break X2; only makes sure
that the inner loop does not iterate more than once. i.e. for each
iteration of i, j only takes the value of 3 and then the j loop
terminates, either because of continue X1; or because of break X2;.
Now, the point to remember here is that when the loop for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) ends,
 the value of i is 3 and not 2. Similarly, if there were no statement inside
inner loop, the value of j after the end of the loop would have been 0 and
not 1.
