What will happen when you compile and run the above program using the
following command line:

java TestClass 1 2

It will print 1

It will print 2

It will print some junk value.

It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

It will throw NumberFormatException //true
//Note: NumberFormatException extends IllegalArgumentException,
which in turn extends RuntimeException.

Explanation
1. Arrays are indexed from 0.
2. In java, the name of the class is not the first element of args.

So, when the command line is : java TestClass 1 2, args[0] is 1 and args[1] is 2.
When you try to access args[2], It will throw an ArrayIndexOutofBoundsException because
the array length is only 2 so args[2] is out of bounds.
