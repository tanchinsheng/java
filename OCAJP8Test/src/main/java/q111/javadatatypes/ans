What will the following program print when compiled and run?

0Z
10Y

10Y //true
0Z
//You are creating two different Data objects in the code.
The first one uses a constructor that takes an integer and the second
one uses a constructor that takes a String.
Thus, when you call showMe on the first object, it prints 10Y because
"Y" is the default value of y as per the given code.
When you call showMe on the second object, it prints 0Z because
0 is the default value of x as per the given code.

It will not compile.

It will throw an exception at run time.

Explanation
//Note that + operator is overloaded for String. So if you have a String
as any operand for +, a new combined String will be created by concatenating
the values of both the operands. Therefore, x+y will result in a String that
concatenates integer x and String y.
