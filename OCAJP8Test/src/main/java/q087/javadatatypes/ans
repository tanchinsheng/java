Which of the following is illegal ?

char c = 320;
//This is valid because 320 is below the maximum value that a char can take,
which is 2^16 -1. Remember that char can take only positive values.

float f = 320;
//320 is an int and any valid int can be assigned to a float or a double
variable without a cast. Note that f = 320.0 is not valid as 320.0
would be a double and a double can only be assigned to a double without a cast.

double d = 320;
//This is valid because any valid int can be assigned to a double or
even a float without any cast.

double d = 320;
/320 cannot fit into a byte so you must cast it.: byte b = (byte) 320;

float f = 22.0f/7.0f;
//Since both the operands of / are floats, it will result in a float,
which can be assigned to f. If you have, 22.0f/7.0,
then it would not compile because 7.0 is a double and so 22.0f/7.0
will return a double, which cannot be assigned to a float. 

None of the above is illegal.
