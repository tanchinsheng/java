Which of the following are NOT valid operators in Java?

sizeof //true
//It is a valid operator in C++ but not in java because size of everything
is known at compile time and is not machine dependent.

<<< //true
//For left shifts there is no difference between shifting signed and
unsigned values so there is only one leftshift '<<' in java.

instanceof

mod //true
//No such thing.

equals //true
//boolean equals(Object o) is a method in java.lang.Object. It is not an operator.
