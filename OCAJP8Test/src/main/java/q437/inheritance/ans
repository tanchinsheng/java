Explanation
Always remember: Instance methods are overridden and variables are hidden.
Which method is invoked depends on the class of the actual object,
while which field is accessed depends on the class of the variable.
Here, b refers to an object of class Beta so b.getH() will always call the
overridden (subclass's method). However, the type of reference of b is Baap.
so b.h will always refer to Baap's h. Further, inside Beta's getH(),
Beta's h will be accessed instead of Baap's h because you are accessing this.h
('this' is implicit) and the type of this is Beta.
The class of bb, on the other hand, is Beta. Thus, bb.h will always refer to Beta's h.
