Consider the following class written by a novice programmer.

After some time, the requirements changed and the programmer now wants to make
sure that radiusB is always (200 - radiusA) instead of (100 - radiusA)
without breaking existing code that other people have written.
Which of the following will accomplish his goal?

Make sum = 200;

Make sum = 200 and make it private.

Make sum = 200 and make all fields (radiusA, radiusB, and sum) private.
//This should have been done when the class was first written.

Write another method setRadius2(int r) and set radiusB accordingly in this method.

His goal cannot be accomplished. //true

This class will not compile.
//There is no problem with the code. Remember, IllegalArgumentException extends
from RuntimeException and is a super class of NumberFormatException

Explanation
setRadius method makes sure that radiusB is set to sum - radiusA.
So changing sum to 200 should do it. However, note that radiusA, radiusB,
and sum are public which means that any other class can access these fields
directly without going through the setRadius method. So there is no way to
make sure that the value of radiusB is correctly set at all times.
If you make them private now, other classes that are accessing the
fields directly will break.

The class should have been coded with proper encapsulation of the fields
in the first place.
