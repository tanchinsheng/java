Explanation
There is no problem with the code.
Remember that before the fields of a subclass can be initialized by a constructor,
the fields of superclass have to be initialized.
Therefore, a super class constructor must first execute before a subclass constructor
can execute.
This order of invocation of constructors goes up the chain up from the subclass
that is being created up to the top most super class,
which is java.lang.Object.

The explicit call to super(); in class Y is not required because the compiler
puts a call to super();
anyway if you don't explicitly call either any super class constructor using
super(...) or
another constructor of the same class using this(...) first ( "..." refers to
appropriate arguments as required for a given constructor).

The declared type of a variable is immaterial here. Only the actual class of
object that is being instantiated is important.
Therefore, if you instantiate class Z, Z's constructor will be invoked, but internally,
that constructor will first invoke Y's constructor before executing the rest of Z's
constructor.
Similarly, Y's constructor will first invoke X's constructor before executing the
rest of Y's constructor.
Finally, X's constructor will first invoke Objects's constructor before executing
 the rest of X's constructor.
Object class's constructor doesn't print anything so no output is generated
because of that. But once that is finished,
the remaining code of X constructor's is executed, which prints "In X", then
the control goes back to Y's constructor,
which prints, "In Y". Finally, the control goes back to Z's constructor,
which prints, "In Z".
