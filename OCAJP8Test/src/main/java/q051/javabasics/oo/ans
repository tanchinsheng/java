Which of the following are features of Java?
Some candidates have reported a similar question being asked with a slightly different (and ambiguous) wording:
Which of the following are objected oriented features of Java?

Every class must have a main method so that it can be tested individually from command line.
//It is not required for a class to have a main method. The main method is required only if you want
to execute that class directly from a command line.
Further, running from command line is not the only way to test a class.

Every class belongs to a package.
//Not entirely true because if you omit the package statement, the class will not be in any package.
It can be argued that all such classes belong to a "default" package but it would be incorrect because
it is not possible to import this default package in other packages. This implies that "default" is not really a package.

A package must have more than one class.
//A package may have just one class as well.

A class may inherit from another class.//true
