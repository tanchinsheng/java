Which of the following declarations are valid?

float f1 = 1.0;
//1.0 is a double.

float f = 43e1;
//43e1 is a double.

float f = -1; //true

float f = 0x0123; //true

float f = 4; //true

Explanation
Although 1.0 and 43e1 can fit into a float, the implicit narrowing does not
happen because implicit narrowing is permitted only among byte, char, short, and int.
