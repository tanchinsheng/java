In the following code, after which statement (earliest),
the object originally held in s, may be garbage collected ?

It will not be Garbage Collected till the end of the program.

Line 5

Line 6

Line 7

Line 10

Explanation
In this case, since there is only one reference to Student object,
as soon as it is set to null, the object held by the reference is
eligible for GC, here it is done at line 6.
Note that although an object is created at line 7 with same parameters,
it is a different object and it will be eligible for GC after line 10.
