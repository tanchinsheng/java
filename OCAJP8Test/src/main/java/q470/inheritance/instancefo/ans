Short k = new Short(9); System.out.println(k instanceof Short); 
// 9 is considered an int and there is no constructor in Short that takes an int. 
Short s = new Short( (short) 9 ); will work.

System.out.println(s instanceof Short);
//The left operand of instanceof MUST be an object and not a primitive.

Short k = 9; System.out.println( k instanceof s);
//Right operand of instanceof MUST be a class name.

int i = 9; System.out.println(s == i); // true
//Any two integral primitives can be compared using == operator.

Boolean b = s instanceof Number;
//Left operand of instanceof MUST be an object and not a primitive.

Short k = 9; Integer i = 9; System.out.println(k == i);
//This will not compile because k and i are referring to objects that have no IS-A relationship among themselves.

Integer i = 9; System.out.println( s == i ); // true
