Which of the following methods can be inserted at line //1 ?

public void teach() throws Exception//true
//It overloads the teach() method instead of overriding it.

private void teach(int i) throws Exception//true
//It overloads the teach() method instead of overriding it.

protected void teach(String s)//true
//This overrides Teacher's teach method. The overriding method can have more
visibility. (It cannot have less. Here, it cannot be private.)

public final void teach(String s)//true
//Overriding method may be made final.

public abstract void teach(String s)
//This is wrong because class Prof has not been declared as abstract.
Note that otherwise it is OK to override a method by an abstract method.

Explanation
Note that 'protected' is less restrictive than default 'no modifier'.
So choice 3 is valid.
"public abstract void teach(String s)" would have been valid if class Prof
had been declared abstract.
