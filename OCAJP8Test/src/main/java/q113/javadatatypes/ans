In which of these variable declarations, will the variable remain uninitialized
unless explicitly initialized?

Declaration of an instance variable of type int.

Declaration of a static class variable of type float.

Declaration of a local variable of type float. //true

Declaration of a static class variable of class Object

Declaration of an instance variable of class Object.

Explanation
We have to explicitly initialize local variables other wise they remain
uninitialized and it will be a compile time error if such variables are
accessed without getting initialized first.
Instance variables and static variables receive  a default value if not
explicitly initialized. All primitive types get a defaults value equivalent
to 0, that is, int to 0 and float to 0.0f and so on and boolean to false.
The type/class of a variable does not affect whether a variable is initialized
or not.
