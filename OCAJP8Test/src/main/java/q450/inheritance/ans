Explanation
If you answered this question incorrectly, you need to understand the concept
of polymorphism. We suggest you to go through any book to understand it thoroughly
because there are several questions in the exam on similar pattern.

In a nutshell, polymorphism means that it is always the class of the object
(and not the class of the reference variable that a variable points to) that
determines which method will be called at run time. The concept of
 doesn't apply to private methods or static methods because these methods are
never inherited.
