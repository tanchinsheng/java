What will be the output of the following program?

It will print 1.

It will print 2. //true

It will print 3.

It will print 4.

It will print 0.

Explanation
& and | do not short circuit the expression but && and || do.
As the value of all the expressions ( 1 through 4) can be determined
just by looking at the first part, && and || do not evaluate the rest
of the expression, so method1() is not called for 2 and 4.
Hence the value of i is incremented only twice.
