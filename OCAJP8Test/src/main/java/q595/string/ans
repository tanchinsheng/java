Which of the following method calls can be applied to a String object?

equals(Object) //true

equalsIgnoreCase(String) //true

prune()
//There is no such method.

append()
//This method is in StringBuffer and StringBuilder but not in String.

intern() //true

Explanation
public String intern()
Returns a canonical representation for the string object.
A pool of strings, initially empty, is maintained privately by the class String.
When the intern method is invoked, if the pool already contains a string equal to this String object as
determined by the equals(Object) method, then the string from the pool is returned.
Otherwise, this String object is added to the pool and a reference to this String object is returned.
It follows that for any two strings s and t, s.intern() == t.intern() is true if and only if s.equals(t) is true.
All literal strings and string-valued constant expressions are interned. String literals are defined in 3.10.5
of the Java Language Specification
Returns:
a string that has the same contents as this string, but is guaranteed to be from a pool of unique strings.
