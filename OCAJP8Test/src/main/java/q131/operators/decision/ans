What will be the output of the following class:

s=aaa sb=bbb

s=null sb=null

s=aaa sb=null

s=null sb=bbbaaa

s=aaa sb=bbbaaabbb //true

Explanation
Always remember that Strings are immutable, you cannot change them.
In this case, s refers to "aaa", and no matter what testRefs() method does,
the variable s of main() will keep pointing to the same string "aaa".
StringBuilder on the other hand, is mutable. So, initially sb is
pointing to a StringBuilder object containing "bbb".
Its reference is passed to the testRefs() method. In that method,
we change the local variable str to point to a new string "aaa"+"bbb" = "aaabbb".
Then we append this to sb. Therefore sb now contains "bbbaaabbb".
Setting the local reference str and sb (in method testRefs()) to null,
does not affect the variables s and sb of the main() method.
