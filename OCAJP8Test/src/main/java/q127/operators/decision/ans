It will say the following when compiled:  
TestClass.java: incompatible types 
found   : boolean required: int 
case x < 5 :        System.out.println("BIG"); break;   

TestClass.java: incompatible types 
found   : boolean 
required: int case x > 5 :        System.out.println("SMALL");  

This is because the type of the case labels must be consistent with the type of the switch condition. 
Here, switch condition is an int, so the case label values must be assignable to the switch condition variable. 
The expression x<5 is of type boolean, which cannot be assigned it x (since it is an int).  

Further, the expression in a switch statement must be of the type 
char, byte, short, int, Character, Byte, Short, Integer, String, or an enum. 
It cannot be a boolean. This is another reason the given code will not compile.  

Further more, the expression in case must generate a constant value. 
Here, the value of the expression x<5 is not constant. 
It is variable. So it is invalid.
