Which of the following is a legal return type of a method overriding the given method:  

public Object  myMethod() {...} (Select the best option.)

Object

String

Return type can be any class since all objects can be cast to Object.//true
// Note that the return type cannot be a primitive such as int or char. It must be a class. 
So it can be Integer or Character as well.

void

None of the above.

Explanation
Version 1.5 onwards, Java allows covariant return types, which means that an overriding method can have its 
return type as any subclass of the return type of the overridden method.

Here, since the return type of the original method is Object, the overriding method can return any object 
type because all classes in Java ultimately extend from Object. 
Note that covariant return types is not applicable to primitives. So for example, if the overridden method 
returns int, the overriding method's return type must also be int. It cannot be short or long. It cannot even be Integer.
