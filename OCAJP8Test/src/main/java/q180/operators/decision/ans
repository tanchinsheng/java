What is the result of executing the following fragment of code:

Compile time error.

It will print true //true

It will print false

Runtime error.

It will print nothing.

Explanation
All that if() needs is a boolean, now b1 == false returns true,
which is a boolean and since b2 = true is an expression and every
expression has a return value (which is the Left Hand Side of the expression),
it returns true, which is again a boolean.  FYI: the return value of
expression  i = 10;  is 10 (an int).
