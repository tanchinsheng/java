What will be the output of the following program ?

It will throw an exception at run time.

It will print IOR

It will print URL://IOR

It will not compile.

None of the above.

Observer that method startUp(String s) of CorbaComponent is overridden by the
subclass OrderManager.

When an object of class OrderManager is constructed, the default no args constructor
of CorbaComponent is called.
This constructor calls the startUp(String s) with "IOR" as parameter.
Now, there are two eligible methods which can be called - CorbaComponent's
startUp and OrderManager's startUp.

The method selection is done on the basis of the actual class of the object
(which is OrderManager here).
So OrderManager's startUp is called, which sets the ior variable to URL://IOR.

Unlike instance method selection, variable (and static method) selection is done on the basis of declared class of the
variable and not on the actual class of object that it is referring to.
