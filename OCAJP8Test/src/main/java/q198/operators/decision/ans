What can be the return type of method getSwitch so that this program
compiles and runs without any problems?

int //true

float

long

double

char

byte

short

Explanation
If you just consider the method getSwitch, any of int long float or
double will do. But the return value is used in the switch statement later on.
A switch condition cannot accept float, long, double, or boolean.
So only int is valid.  The return type cannot be byte, short, or
char because the expression x - 20/x + x*x; returns an int.
