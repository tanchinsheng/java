What should be placed in the two blanks so that the following code will compile
without errors:

XXX and YYY

XXX and XXX

YYY and YYY

YYY and XXX

None of the options will make the code compile.//true
//Remember that an overriding method can only throw a subset of checked exceptions
declared in the throws clause of the overridden method.
Here, method m in XXX does not declare any checked exception in its throws clause,
therefore, method m in YYY cannot declare any checked exception in its throws
clause either.
Class YYY will, therefore, not compile.
