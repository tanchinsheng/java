Explanation
Please read the following description of substring method of String and delete method of StringBuilder:

public String substring(int beginIndex)   

Returns a new string that is a substring of this string.
The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of this string.
Examples:
"unhappy".substring(2) returns "happy"
"Harbison".substring(3) returns "bison"
"emptiness".substring(9) returns "" (an empty string)
public StringBuilder delete(int start, int end)   

Removes the characters in a substring of this sequence. The substring begins at the specified start and
extends to the character at index end - 1 or to the end of the sequence if no such character exists.
If start is equal to end, no changes are made.
