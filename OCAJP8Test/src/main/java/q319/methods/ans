What will be the output when the following program is run?

Compile time error.
//c is an instance variable of numeric type so it will be given a default value of 0,
which prints as empty space.

 ,m
//Without the cast to int, c would be printed as empty space and cA[1] is 'm'

0,m//true
//Because of the explicit cast to int in the println() call, c will be printed as 0.

b,b

b,m

Explanation
Note that Arrays are Objects (i.e. cA instanceof Object is true) so are
effectively passed by reference. So in m1() the change in cA[1] done by m2()
is reflected everywhere the array is used. c is a primitive type and is passed by value.
In method m2() the passed parameter c is different than instance variable 'c'
as local variable hides the instance variable. So instance member 'c'
keeps its default (i.e. 0) value.
