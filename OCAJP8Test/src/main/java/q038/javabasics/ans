// 1 and // 4

// 3 and // 4 //true

// 2 and // 4

// 2 and // 3

Explanation
// 1 is valid because it is a valid code that declares a class.

// 2 is a valid declaration of a method named main.
Although, it is not a correct declaration for the standard main method that can be used to execute the class,
but it is a valid method nevertheless.

// 3 is invalid syntax. It can be written as either double x=10; double y;  
or double x=10, y; Note that even though x is a double and 10 is an int,
it is valid because 10 will automatically be converted to a double.
The reverse would not be valid i.e. int x = 10.0; will be invalid. You need a cast for that: int x = (int) 10.0;

//4 is invalid because println is not a class name. So you cannot create an array of it.
println is a method. So it should be written as System.out.println();

//5 is a valid declaration of a for loop.
