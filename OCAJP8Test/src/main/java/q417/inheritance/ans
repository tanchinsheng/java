Replace the method body of m2() with a ; (semi-colon). //true

Replace the ; at the end of m1() with a method body.

Remove abstract from m2(). // true
//A method that has a body cannot be abstract. In other words, an abstract method cannot have a body. 
So either remove the method body (as in m1()) or remove abstract keyword.

Remove abstract from the class declaration.
