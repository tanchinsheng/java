For answering such questions, it is best to use a pen and a paper and start executing the code line by line.

The i of the outer loop runs from 0 to < ab.length, which is 2. i.e. i will be 0 and then 1.
The j of the inner loop runs from 0 to < ab[i].length, 
which is 3 for the first iteration of the outer for loop and 2 for the second iteration of the outer for loop.

Thus, for the first iteration of the outer for loop - the inner for loop prints ab[0][0] 
i.e. 1 , ab[0][1] i.e. 2 and then since the if condition is satisfied, 
the inner loop ends and the second iteration of the outer for loop begins.

For the second iteration of the outer for loop - the inner for loop prints ab[1][0] i.e. 4 , ab[1][1] i.e. 5.

The continue statement in this case is redundant because there is no statement left to execute after continue in the for loop anyway.
