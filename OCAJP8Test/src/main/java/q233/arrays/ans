Which of the following statements about an array are correct?

An array can dynamically grow in size. // Wrong
Arrays cannot grow in size once created. ArrayLists can do that.

Arrays can be created only for primitive types. // Wrong 
You can have arrays for objects also. 
For example: 
Object[] objArray = new Object[4]; 
String[] arrayOfStrings = { "a", "b" };

Every array has a built in property named 'size' which tells you the number of elements in the array. // Wrong
It is named length and not size. ArrayList has a method named size() that returns the number of elements in the ArrayList.  
String[] sa = { "a", "b" }; 
int k = sa.length; //k will be assigned a value of 2.  
ArrayList al = new ArrayList(); 
int k = al.size(); //k will be assigned a value of 0.

Every array has in implicit method named 'length' which tells you the number of elements in the array. // Wrong

Element indexing starts at 0. // Correct
