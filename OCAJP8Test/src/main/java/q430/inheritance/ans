What can be done to make this code compile?

Nothing, it will compile as it is.

Make Eagle class declaration public: public class Eagle { ... }

Make the Eagle constructor private: private Eagle(String name){ ... } //true

Make Bird constructor public: public Bird() { ... }
Insert super(); as the first line in Eagle constructor:     
public Eagle(String name){         
    super();         
    his.name = name;     
}
//If a subclass class constructor doesn't explicitly call the super class constructor,
the compiler automatically inserts super(); as the first statement of the subclass
constructor. So this option is not needed.

Explanation
Since the constructor of Bird is private, the subclass cannot access it and therefore,
it needs to be made public. protected or default access is also valid.
