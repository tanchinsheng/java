Which of the following is correct about Java byte code?

It can run on any OS and chip architecture.

It can run on any OS and chip architecture if there is a JRE available for that OS and chip architecture.//true

It can run only any OS and chip architecture if that platform has a JRE built for it and the Java code was compiled ON that platform.

It can run only any OS and chip architecture if that platform has a JRE built for it and the Java code was compiled FOR that platform.

Explanation
Java byte code is basically just a set of instructions that are intepreted by a virtual machine and is
independent of the actual machine and OS i.e. the platform. JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is the virtual machine
that interprets the given byte code and converts it into the acutal platform understandable instructions.
Therefore, all you need to run the byte code is the virtual machine (JRE) for that specific platform on which you want to run it.

Since the byte code itself is platform independent, you can compile your java code on any platform because
no matter where you compile your code, the same byte code will be produced.
Therefore, you don't need a java compiler for a particular platform. You just need the JRE for that platform.
Oracle provides JRE for several platforms inluding Windows and Unix.
