Replace Logger logger = new Logger(); with:
log4j.Logger logger = new log4j.Logger();
//If you are not importing a class or the package of the class,
you need to use the class's fully qualified name while using it.
Here, you need to use util.log4j.Logger instead
of just log4j.Logger: util.log4j.Logger logger = new util.log4j.Logger();

Replace package util.log4j; with package util;//true
//This will put both the classes in the same package and TestClass
can then directly use Logger class without importing anything.

Replace Logger logger = new Logger(); with: //true
util.log4j.Logger logger = new util.log4j.Logger();
//Using a fully qualified class name always works irrespective of
whether you import the package or not.
In this case, you are importing package util but Logger is in util.log4j.
Therefore, the use of fully qualified class name for Logger,
which is util.log4j.Logger, makes it work.

Remove package util.log4j; from Logger.
//Remember that you can never access a class that is defined in
the default package (i.e. the package with no name)
from a class in any other package.
So if you remove the package statement from Logger,
you can't access it from util package, which is where TestClass is.

Add import log4j; to TestClass.
//This will not help because Logger is in util.log4j package and
not in log4j package.
