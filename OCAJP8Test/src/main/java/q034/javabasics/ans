What should be inserted at //1 so that TestClass will compile and run?

import static x.y.*;
//x.y.* means all the classes in package x.y. Classes cannot be imported using "import static".
You must do import x.y.* for importing class. Further, importing a class will not give you a direct access
to the members of the class. You will need to do SM.foo(), if you import SM.

import static x.y.SM;
//x.y.SM means you are trying to import class SM that belongs to package x.y. A class cannot be imported statically.

import static x.y.SM.foo; //true
//This is valid because this statement is importing the static member foo of class x.y.SM.

import static x.y.SM.foo();
//Even though foo is a method, you cannot put () in the import statement.

import static x.y.SM.*; //true
//This is valid because this statement is importing all the static members of class x.y.SM.
