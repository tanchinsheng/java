Given the following code fragment, which of the following lines would
be a part of the output?

i = 1, j = 0

i = 0, j = 1

i = 1, j = 2

i = 2, j = 1

i = 2, j = 2

Explanation
The given code prints:
i=1, j=0
i=2, j=0
i=2, j=1
The variable i iterates through the values 0, 1 and 2 in the outer loop,
while j varies from 0 to 1 in the inner loop.
If the values of i and j are equal, the continue statement is executed
and printing is skipped and next iteration of outer
'for' loop starts.
