Expression (s instanceof java.util.Date) will return false if 's' was declared as a variable of class java.lang.String.

Explanation
It will not even compile because the compiler knows that 's' (which is declared as of class String) can NEVER 
refer to an object of class java.util.Date. So, it will not accept this code. Had 's' been declared as a variable 
of type Object, this code would have compiled because compiler sees that at run time it is possible for s to refer 
to an object of class Date.
