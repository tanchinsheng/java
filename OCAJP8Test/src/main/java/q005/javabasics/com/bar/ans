import static X;

import static com.foo.*;
//Bad syntax. Package import does not use static keyword.

import static com.foo.X.*;
//This static import, although syntactically correct, will not help here because Y is accessing class X in X.LOGICID.

import com.foo.*; //true
//This is required because Y is accessing class X. static import of LOGICID is NOT required because Y
is accessing LOGICID through X ( X.LOGICID). Had it been just System.out.println(LOGICID),
only one import statement: import static com.foo.X.*; would have worked.

import com.foo.X.LOGICID;
//Bad Syntax. Syntax for importing static fields is:
import static <package>.<classname>.*; or import static <package>.<classname>.<fieldname>;
