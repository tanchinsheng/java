What will the following code print?

1

2

3 //true

4

Compilation error.

Explanation
At the beginning, flag is true. In the first if, we do flag = false.
Notice that it is not flag == false. It is a single =,
which assigns false to flag. Thus, flag becomes false and the condition
becomes false therefore 1 is not printed. In the first 'else if',
again since flag is false, 2 is not printed. In second 'else if',
!flag implies !false, which is true, so 3 is printed.
Finally, since an else-if condition has been satisfied,
the last else is not executed.
