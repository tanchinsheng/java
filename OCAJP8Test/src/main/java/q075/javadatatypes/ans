Which of these are NOT legal declarations within a class?

static int sa ;

final Object[ ] objArr = { null } ;
//Declares and defines an array of Objects of length 1.

abstract int t ;
//Variables can't be declared as abstract or native.

abstract void format( ) ;

final static private double PI = 3.14159265358979323846 ;

Explanation
static and final are valid modifiers for both member field and method
declarations within a class. transient and volatile modifiers are only
valid for member field declarations. abstract and native are only valid
for member methods.

Note: a class declaration can have only final,
abstract and public as modifiers, unless it is a nested class,
in which case, it can be declared private or  protected as well.
Within a method, a local variable may be declared as final
