Which of the following options when applied individually will change
the Data object currently referred to by the variable d to contain 2,
2 as values for its data fields?

Add the following two statements: d.x = 2; d.y = 2; //true

Add the following statement: d = new Data(2, 2);
//This will create a new Data object and will not change the original
Data object referred to be d.

Add the following two statements: d.x += 1; d.y += 1;//true

Add the following statement: d = d + 1;
//This will not compile because Java does not allow operator
overloading for user defined objects.
