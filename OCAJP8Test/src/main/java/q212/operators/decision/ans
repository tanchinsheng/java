Note that  boolean operators have more precedence than =. 
(In fact, = has least precedence of all operators.)
so, in (b2 != b1 = !b2)  first b2 != b1 is evaluated which returns a value 'false'. 
So the expression becomes false = !b2. And this is illegal because false is a value and not a variable!
 
Had it been something like (b2 = b1 != b2) then it is valid because it will boil down to : b2 = false.
Because all an if() needs is a boolean, now b1 != b2 returns false which is a boolean and 
as b2 =  false is an expression and every expression has a return value 
(which is actually the Left Hand Side of the expression). Here, it returns false, which is again a boolean.

Note that return value of expression :  i = 10 , where i is an int, is 10 (an int).
