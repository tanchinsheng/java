0 followed by 100.

100 followed by 100.

0 followed by 200.//true

100 followed by 200.

Explanation

There are a couple of important concepts in this question:

1. Within an instance method, you can access the current object of the same class using 'this'.
Therefore, when you access this.myValue, you are accessing the instance member myValue of the ChangeTest instance.

2. Within the showOne() method, there are two variables accessible with the same name myValue.
If you declare a local variable (or a method parameter) with the same name as the instance field name,
the local variable "shadows" the member field. One is the method parameter and another is the member field of ChangeTest object.
Ideally, you should be able to access the member field in the method directly by using the name of the member
(in this example, myValue).

However, because of shadowing, when you use myValue, it refers to the local variable instead of the instance field.
Therefore, when you do : myValue = myValue; you are actually assigning the value contained in method parameter myValue to itself.
You are not changing the member field myValue. Hence, when you do System.out.println(this.myValue); in the next line, it prints 0.
Now, in showTwo(), you are assigning the value contained in myValue (i.e. 200) to this.myValue, which is the instance member.  
Therefore, in the next line, when you print this.myValue, it prints 200.
