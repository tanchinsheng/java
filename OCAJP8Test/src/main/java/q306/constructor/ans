Under what situations does a class get a default constructor?

All classes in Java get a default constructor.
//No. If a class defines a constructor explicitly,
it will not get the default constructor.

You have to define at least one constructor to get the default constructor.
//A default (no args one) will be given if the class doesn't define any.

If the class does not define any constructors explicitly.
//In this case, the compiler will add a no args constructor for this class.

All classes get default constructor from Object class.
/Constructors are NEVER inherited.

None of the above.
