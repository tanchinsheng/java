Which statements about the output of the following programs are true?

1 will be the part of the output.//true
//& (unlike &&), when used as a logical operator, does not short circuit
the expression, which means it always evaluates both the operands even if
the result of the whole expression can be known by just evaluating the left operand.

2 will be the part of the output.

3 will be the part of the output.//true
//& and | (unlike && and ||), when used as logical operators,
do not short circuit the expression, which means they always evaluate
both the operands even if the result of the whole expression can be
known by just evaluating the left operand.

4 will be the part of the output

None of the above

Explanation
& and | do not short circuit the expression.
The value of all the expressions ( 1 through 4) can be determined
just by looking at the first part. && and || do not evaluate the
 rest of the expression if the result of the whole expression can
be known by just evaluating the left operand, so method1() is not
called for 2 and 4.
