/**
 * Created by yaodh on 2014/12/13.
 * 1. StrSymmetryPoint
 * Find a symmetry point of a string, if any.
 * Task description
 * Write a function:
 * class Solution { public int solution(String S); }
 * that, given a string S, returns the index (counting from 0) of a character
 * such that the part of the string to the left of that character is a reversal of the part of the string to its right.
 * The function should return âˆ’1 if no such index exists.
 * Note: reversing an empty string (i.e. a string whose length is zero) gives an empty string.
 * For example, given a string:
 * "racecar"
 * the function should return 3, because the substring to the left of the character "e" at index 3 is "rac",
 * and the one to the right is "car".
 * Given a string:
 * "x"
 * the function should return 0, because both substrings are empty.
 * Assume that:
 * the length of S is within the range [0..2,000,000].
 * Complexity:
 * expected worst-case time complexity is O(length(S));
 * expected worst-case space complexity is O(1) (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
