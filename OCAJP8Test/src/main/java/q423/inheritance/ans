How can you let perform_work() method of A to be called from an instance method in C?

( (A) this ).perform_work( );

super.perform_work( );

super.super.perform_work( );

this.super.perform_work( );

It is not possible.

Explanation
The method in C needs to call a method in a superclass two levels up.
But super is a keyword and not an attribute so super.super.perform_work( )
strategy will not work. There is no way to go more than one level up for methods
 Remember that this problem doesn't occur for instance variables because
variable are never overridden. They are shadowed. So to access any of the
super class's variable, you can unshadow it using a cast.
For example, ((A) c).data; This will give you the data variable defined in A even
if it is shadowed in B as well as in C.
