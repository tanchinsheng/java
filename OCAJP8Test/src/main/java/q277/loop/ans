You have been given an array of objects and you need to process this array as follows -
1. Call a method on each object from first to last one by one.
2. Call a method on each object from last to first one by one.
3. Call a method on only those objects at even index (0, 2, 4, 6, etc.)

Which of the following are correct?

Please select 1 option

Enhanced for loops can be used for all the three tasks.

Enhanced for loop can by used for only the first task.
For the rest, standard for loops can be used. // true

Standard for loops can be used for tasks 1 and 2 but not 3.

All the tasks can be performed either by using only standard for loops
or by using only enhanced for loops.

Neither standard for loops nor enhanced for loops can be used for all three tasks.

Explanation
The enhanced for loop is tailor made for processing each element of a
collection (or an array) in order.
Most importantly, it does not give you an iterating variable that you
can manipulate and that makes it
impossible to change the order or to skip an element. Therefore, tasks
2 and 3 cannot be done by an enhanced for loop.
The standard for loop is very flexible. It can do pretty much anything.
Here is how you can do task 2 and 3 using a standard for loop -

//processing in reverse
for(int i=arr.length-1; i>=0; i--){   
    arr[i].m1();
}

//processing alternate
for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i=i+2){   
    arr[i].m1();
}
