To understand how this loop works let us put some extra print statements in the innermost loop:
System.out.println("i="+i+" j="+j+" k="+k);
if(k-j>0){
     System.out.println("breaking middle "+j);
     break middle;
}
counter++;
This is what it prints:
i=0 j=0 k=0
i=0 j=0 k=1
breaking middle 0
i=1 j=0 k=0
i=1 j=0 k=1
breaking middle 0
i=2 j=0 k=0
i=2 j=0 k=1
breaking middle 0
3
The key is that the middle loop is broken as soon as k-j becomes > 0. 
This happens on every second iteration of inner loop when k is 1 and j is 0. 
Now, when middle is broken inner cannot continue. So the next iteration of outer starts.
