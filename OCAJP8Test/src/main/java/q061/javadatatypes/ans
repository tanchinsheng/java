Hello World

Hello World Good Bye

Good Bye

Explanation
str.substring(1, str.length()-1) => "--0.50".substring(1, (6-1) ) => -0.5
Math.round(-0.5) = 0.0 so getSwitch(...) returns 0 if passed an argument of "--0.50".
Now, there is no "break" in case 0 of switch. so the control falls through to the
next case ( i.e. case 1) after printing Hello. At case 1, it prints World.
And since there is a break. default is not executed.
Observe that rounding is a standard mathematical procedure
where the number that lies exactly between two numbers always rounds
up to the higher one. So .5 rounds to 1 and -.5 rounds to 0.
