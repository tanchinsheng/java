What will be printed when you try to compile and run class B?

It will print A.

It will print B.

It will not compile.//true
//Because A() is not accessible in B.

It will compile but will not run.

None of the above.

Explanation
Note that there is no modifier for A's constructor. So it has default access.
This means only classes in package a can use it. Also note that class B is in
a different package and is extending from A. In B's constructor the compiler
will automatically add super() as the first line. But since A() is not accessible in B,
this code will not compile.
