What can be inserted at //1 and //2?

return a(x)*b(y);
and
matrix(x, y) = compute(x, y);
//( and ) are used to call a method on an object.
To access array elements, you need to use [ and ].

return a[x]*b[y];
and
matrix[x, y] = compute(x, y);

return a[x]*b[y];
and
matrix[x][y] = compute(x, y);//true

return a(x)*b(y);
and
matrix(x)(y) = compute(x, y);
//a(x), b(y), and matrix(x)(y) are invalid because a, b, and matrix are not methods.

return a[x]*b[y];
and
matrix[[x][y]] = compute(x, y);
//[[x][y]] is invalid syntax.

Explanation
The correct syntax to access any element within an array is to use
the square brackets - [ ]. Thus, to access the first element in an array,
you would use array[0].  For a multi dimensional array,
to reach an individual item, you need to specify index for each dimension.
For example, since matrix is a two dimensional array, matrix is an
array of array and matrix[0] will give you the first array of the arrays.
matrix[0][0] will give you the first element of the first array of the arrays.
