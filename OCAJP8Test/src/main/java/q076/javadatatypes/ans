Given that TestClass is a class, how many objects and reference variables
are created by the following code?

TestClass t1, t2, t3, t4;
t1 = t2 = new TestClass();
t3 = new TestClass();

2 objects, 3 references.

2 objects, 4 references.//true
//two news => two objects. t1, t2, t3, t4 => 4 references.

3 objects, 2 references.

2 objects, 2 references.

None of the above.

Explanation
A declared reference variable exists regardless of whether a reference value
(i.e. an object) has been assigned to it or not.
