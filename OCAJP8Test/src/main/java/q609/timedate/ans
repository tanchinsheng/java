Which of the following are valid ways to create a LocalDateTime?

java.time.LocalDate.parse("2015-01-02");
//To create an instance of LocalDateTime, you need to use the methods in LocalDateTime class.
Methods in LocalDate class create LocalDate instances. Similarly, methods in LocalTime class create LocalTime instances.

java.time.LocalDateTime.parse("2015-01-02");
//LocalDateTime requires date as well as time.
Here, you just have a date in the input so it will throw a java.time.format.DateTimeParseException.
java.time.LocalDateTime.parse("2015-01-02T17:13:50"); would be valid.


java.time.LocalDateTime.of(2015, 10, 1, 10, 10); //true

java.time.LocalDateTime.of(2015, "January", 1, 10, 10);
//All parameters should be ints.
For the month argument, you can either pass the numbers 1 to 12  (and not 0 to 11)
or use constants such as java.time.Month.JANUARY.
