Is it possible to create arrays of length zero?

Yes, you can create arrays of any type with length zero. // True

Java allows arrays of length zero to be created.  
Here is an example:
int[] zeroLengthArray1 = new int[0];
System.out.println(zeroLengthArray1.length); //will print 0
String[] zeroLengthArray2 = new String[0];
System.out.println(zeroLengthArray2.length);  //will print 0

Yes, but only for primitive datatypes. // Wrong

Yes, but only for arrays of object references. //Wrong

Yes, and it is same as a null Array. // Wrong
//A null pointer is different from an array of length zero.
A reference being null or pointing to null means it is not pointing to anything at all.
But an array of length zero is a valid object.
Thus, a reference pointing to such an array is not pointing to null.
For example, if you have int[] intArr = new int[0]; then (intArr == null) is false.

No, arrays of length zero do not exist in Java. // Wrong

Explanation....
Example: When a Java program is run without any program arguments,
the String[] args argument to main() gets an array of length Zero.
