Which of the following statements is/are true?

Subclasses must define all the abstract methods that the superclass defines. // False
Not if the subclass is also defined abstract!

A class implementing an interface must define all the methods of that interface. // False
Not if the class is defined abstract. Further, Java 8 allows an interface to have default and static methods, 
which need not be implemented by a non-abstract class that says it implements that interface.

A class cannot override the super class's constructor //True
Because constructors are not inherited.

It is possible for two classes to be the superclass of each other. // False

An interface can implement multiple interfaces. //False
Interface cannot "implement" another interfaces. It can extend multiple interfaces. 
The following is a valid declaration : interface I1 extends I2, I3, I4 { }
