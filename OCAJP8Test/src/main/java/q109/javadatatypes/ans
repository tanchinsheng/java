Given the following class, which of the given blocks can be inserted at line 1
without errors?

static {System.out.println("Static"); } //true

static { loop = 1; } //true

static { loop += INTERVAL; } //true

static { INTERVAL = 10; }
//INTERVAL is final and so it can never be changed after it is given a value.

{ flag = true; loop = 0; } //true
//flag is not static and so it can be accessed only from a non-static block.
loop is static so can be accessed from any block.
