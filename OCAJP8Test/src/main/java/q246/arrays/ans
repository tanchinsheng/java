The statement iA[i] = i = 30 ; will be processed as follows:
iA[i] = i = 30; => iA[0] = i = 30 ;  =>  i = 30; iA[0] = i ; =>   iA[0] = 30 ;

Here is what JLS says on this:
1 Evaluate Left-Hand Operand First  
2 Evaluate Operands before Operation  
3 Evaluation Respects Parentheses and Precedence  
4 Argument Lists are Evaluated Left-to-Right  

For Arrays: First, the dimension expressions are evaluated, left-to-right. 
If any of the expression evaluations completes abruptly, the expressions to the right of it are not evaluated.
