Which of the following are benefits of polymorphism?

It makes the code more reusable. //true

It makes the code more efficient.
//This option is a bit ambiguous because it is not clear which efficiency is it talking about - execution, memory, or maintenance.
Our guess is that it is referring to execution efficiency.
It is not true because polymorphism causes a very slight degradation due to dynamic binding at run time.

It protects the code by preventing extension.
//Just the reverse is true. Extension is how polymorphism is achieved.

It makes the code more dynamic. //true
//Polymophism allows the actual decision of which method is to be invoked to be taken at runtime based on the actual class of object.
This is dynamic binding and makes the code more dynamic.
