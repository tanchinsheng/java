Given that OurClass is a MyClass and OurClass has a YourClass object.
Which of the following options are correct?
(Assume that OurClass, MyClass, and YourClass are valid java classes.)

MyClass contains a reference to OurClass

OurClass contains a reference to MyClass

MyClass contains a reference to YourClass

OurClass contains a reference to YourClass //true

OurClass inherits from MyClass //true

Explantion
Visualize the hierarchy like this: OurClass is a MyClass => OurClass extends  (or inherits from) MyClass.
Thus, option 5 is correct. OurClass has a YourClass => OurClass refers to (or contains a reference to) YourClass object.
Thus, option 4 is correct.
