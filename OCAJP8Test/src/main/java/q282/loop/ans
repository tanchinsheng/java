How many times will the line marked //1 be called in the following code?

0

1

9

10

None of these//true

Explanation
A do-while loop is always executed at least once.
So in the first iteration, x is decremented and becomes 9.
Now the while condition is tested, which returns true because 9 is less than 10.
So the loop is executed again with x = 9. In the loop, x is decremented to 8 and
the condition is tested again, which again returns true because 8 is less than 10.

As you can see, x keeps on decreasing by one in each iteration and every time
the condition x<10 returns true. However, after x reaches -2147483648,
which is its MIN_VALUE, it cannot decrease any further and at this time
when x-- is executed, the value rolls over to 2147483647,
which is Integer.MAX_VALUE. At this time, the condition x<10 fails and the
loop terminates.
