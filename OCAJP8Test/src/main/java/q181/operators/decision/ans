1. A char value can ALWAYS be assigned to an int variable, 
since the int type is wider than the char type. So line 2 is valid.

2. Line 4 will not compile because it is trying to assign an int to a char. 
Although the value of i can be held by the char but since  'i' is not a constant but a variable, implicit narrowing will not occur.

Here is the rule given in JLS:
A narrowing primitive conversion may be used if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

The expression is a constant expression of type int.

The type of the variable is byte, short, or char.

The value of the expression (which is known at compile time, because it is a constant expression) 
is representable in the type of the variable.

Note that narrowing conversion does not apply to long or double.

so, char ch = 30L; will fail although 30 is representable by a char.
