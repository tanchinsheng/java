Consider the following variable declaration within the definition of an interface:   

int i = 10; Which of the following declarations defined in a non-abstract class,
is equivalent to the above?

public static int i = 10;

public final int i = 10;

public static final int i = 10;//true

public int i = 10;

final int i = 10;

Explanation
Fields in an interface are implicitly public, static and final.
Although you can put these words in the interface definition but it is not a
good practice to do so.
