// When the program is called with no arguments, the args array will be of length zero.

Explanation
When the program is called with no arguments, the args array will be of length zero.
Unlike in C/C++, args[0] is not the name of the program or class.
This is because the name of the class is always the same as defined in the java file.
So there is no need for passing its name as an argument to main method.
