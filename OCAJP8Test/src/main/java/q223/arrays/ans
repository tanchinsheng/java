Which of the following options can be used in the code above so that the init method
initializes each table element to the sum of its row and column number and the multiply
method just multiplies the element value by 2?

table[x, y] = x+y;
and
table[x, y] = table[x, y]*2;

table[x][y] = x+y;
and
table[x][y] = table[x][y]*2; //true
//This code snippet illustrates correct syntax for accessing array elements
in a multi dimensional array. All other options are syntactically incorrect
and will not compile.

table[[x] [y]] = x+y;
and
table[[x] [y]] = table[[x] [y]]*2;

table(x, y) = x+y;
and
table(x, y) = table(x, y)*2;
