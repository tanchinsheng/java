The compiler will refuse to compile it because i and b are of different types
cannot be assigned to each other.

The program will compile and will print -128 and -128 when run //true
//A byte can ALWAYS be assigned to an int.

The compiler will refuse to compile it because -128 is outside the
legal range of values for a byte.
//Range of byte is -128 to 127

The program will compile and will print 128 and -128 when run.

The program will compile and will print 255 and -128 when run.

Explanation
byte and int both hold signed values. So when b is assigned to i,
the sign is preserved.
