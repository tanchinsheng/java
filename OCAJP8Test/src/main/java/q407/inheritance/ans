It will print "hello world" followed by "good bye".

Explanation
new B("good bye"); will call class B's one args constructor which in turn
calls super(s, " world"); (i.e. class A's two args constructor) which in
turn calls this(s1 + s2); (i.e. class A's one arg constructor with parameter
"good bye world") which prints it.
