It will throw AssertionError out of the main method. //true
//A subclass of Error cannot be caught using a catch block for Exception because java.lang.Error does not extend java.lang.Exception.

It will print EXCEPTION.
//The catch block will not be able to catch the Error thrown by methodX().

It will not compile because of the throws clause in methodX().
//The throws clause is valid even though unnecessary in this case.

It will end without printing anything because assertions are disabled by default.
//It is true that assertions are disabled by default however, methodX is throwing an
//AssertionError explicitly like any other Throwable. Here, the assertion mechanism is not even used.
