Which of the following statements are true?

System.out.println(1 + 2 + "3"); would print 33.//true
//operator + is left associative so evaluation of (1 + 2 + "3" ) is as follows:
//( 1 + 2 ) + "3" -> 3 + "3" -> "33".

System.out.println("1" + 2 + 3); would print 15.
//evaluation of ("1" + 2 + 3) is as follows: ("1" + 2) + 3 -> "12" + 3 -> "123".

System.out.println(4 + 1.0f); would print 5.0 //true
//(4 + 1.0f ) evaluates as 4.0f + 1.0f ->5.0f -> 5.0

System.out.println(5/4); would print 1.25
//(5/4) performs integer division because both 5 and 4
// are integers, resulting in the value 1.

System.out.println('a' + 1 ); would print b.
//Both operands in the expression ( 'a' + 1 ) will be promoted to int => 97 + 1 = 98

Explanation
All operands of type byte, char or short are promoted AT LEAST to an int
before performing mathematical operations. If one of the operands is
larger than an int then the other one is promoted to the same type.
Note that System.out.println((float)5/4); will print 1.25.
If you remove the explicit cast (float), it will print 1.
