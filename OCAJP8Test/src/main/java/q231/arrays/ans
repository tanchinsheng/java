Which of the following correctly declare a variable which can hold an array of 10 integers?

int[ ] iA // Correct

int[10] iA // Wrong
Size of the array is NEVER specified on the Left Hand Side.

int iA[ ] // Correct

Object[ ] iA // Wrong
Here, iA is an array of Objects. It cannot hold an array of integers.

Object[10] iA // Wrong
Size of the array is NEVER specified on the LHS.

Explanation
Note that an array of integers IS an Object : 
Object obj = new int[]{ 1, 2, 3 }; // is valid. 
But it is not an array of objects. 
Object[] o = new int[10]; // is not valid.  

Difference between the placement of square brackets: 
int[] i, j; //here i and j are both array of integers. 
int i[], j; //here only i is an array of integers. j is just an integer.
