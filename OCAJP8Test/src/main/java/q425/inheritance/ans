Given the following interface definition, which definitions are valid?

class A extends I1{    
    String s;    
    void setValue(String val) { s = val; }    
    String getValue() { return s; }
}
//Classes do not extend interfaces, they implement interfaces.

interface I2 extends I1{    void analyse(); }

abstract class B implements I1{    int getValue(int i) { return 0; } }

interface I3 implements I1{    void perform_work(); }
//Interfaces do not implement anything, they can extend multiple interfaces.

Explanation
The getValue(int i) method of class B in option c, is different than the method
defined in the interface because their parameters are different. Therefore, this
class does not actually implement the method of the interface and that is why it
needs to be declared abstract.
