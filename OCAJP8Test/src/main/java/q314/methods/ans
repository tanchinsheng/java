What will the following class print when compiled and run?

It will not compile because 'a' is final.
//'a' is final is true, but that only means that a will keep pointing to the same
object for the entire life of the program. The object's internal fields,
however, can change.

It will not compile because method setIt() cannot change x.link.
//Since x and y are final, the method cannot change x and y to point to
some other object but it can change the objects' internal fields.

It will print 5, 10.

It will print 10, 10.

It will throw an exception when run.//true
//When method setIt() executes, x.link = y.link, x.link becomes null because
y.link is null so a.link.value throws NullPointerException.

Explanation
It will not compile because 'a' is final.
'a' is final is true, but that only means that a will keep pointing to
the same object for the entire life of the program.
The object's internal fields, however, can change.

It will not compile because method setIt() cannot change x.link.
Since x and y are final, the method cannot change what x and y to point
to some other object
but it can change the objects' internal fields.

It will print 5, 10.

It will print 10, 10.

It will throw an exception when run.//Correct
When method setIt() executes, x.link = y.link, x.link becomes null because
y.link is null so a.link.value throws NullPointerException.
