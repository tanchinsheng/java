What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

Data Type of 'x' is not valid to be used as an expression for the switch clause.
//x is an int and int is perfectly valid. long, double, boolean, and float are not valid.

The case label 0 must precede case label 1.
//While ordering may be important for the logic being implemented in the code,
technically, any order is valid.

Each case section must end with a break keyword.
//This is not necessary. If there is no break at the end of a case section,
the control will fall through to the next case section
(even if the case label doesn't match).

The default label must be the last label in the switch statement.
//Any order of case statements is valid.

There is nothing wrong with the code.//true

Explanation
Here are the rules for a switch statement:
1. Only String, byte, char, short, int, (and their wrapper classes Byte,
Character, Short, and Integer), and enums can be used as types of a switch variable.
(String is allowed only since Java 7).
2. The case constants must be assignable to the switch variable.
For example, if your switch variable is of class String,
your case labels must use Strings as well.
3. The switch variable must be big enough to hold all the case constants.
For example, if the switch variable is of type char, then none of the case
constants can be greater than 65535 because a char's range is from 0 to 65535.
4.  All case labels should be COMPILE TIME CONSTANTS.
5. No two of the case constant expressions associated with a switch
statement may have the same value.
6. At most one default label may be associated with the same switch statement.
