What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following class?

The code will fail to compile because the syntax of the if statement is not correct.
//It is perfectly valid.

The code will fail to compile because the values in the condition bracket are invalid.
//Any expression that returns a boolean is valid.
false and true are valid expressions that return boolean.

The code will compile correctly and will not display anything.

The code will compile correctly and will display True True. //true

The code will compile correctly and will display True True.

Explanation
This code can be rewritten as follows:
public class IfTest{
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        if (true) {
            if (false) {
                System.out.println("True False");
            } else {
                System.out.println("True True");
            }
        }
    }
}
Notice how the last "else" is associated with the last "if" and
not the first "if". Now, the first if condition returns true so the next
'if' will be executed. In the second 'if' the condition returns false
so the else part will be evaluated which prints 'True True'.
