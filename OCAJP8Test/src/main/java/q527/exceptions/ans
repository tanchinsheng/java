You have a method that currently does not handle any exception thrown from the code contained in its method body.
You are now changing this method to call another method that throws IOException.

What changes, independent of each other, can you make to your method so that it will compile?

Set the exception to null and don't rethrow it.
//This option doesn't make sense. To get the exception, you first need to catch it.

Declare IOException in the throws clause of your method.//true

Wrap the call to another method within a try-catch block that catches RuntimeException.
//java.io.IOException extends Exception. It cannot be caught by a catch block that catches RuntimeException.


Wrap the call to another method within a try-catch block that catches Exception.//true
//Since IOException is an Exception, you can catch it with a catch block that catches Exception.
