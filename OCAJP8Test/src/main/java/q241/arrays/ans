Which of the following are valid code fragments:

new Object[]{ "aaa", new Object(), new ArrayList(), 10};//true
//10 is a primitive and not an Object but due to auto-boxing it will
be converted into an Integer object and that object will then be stored
into the array of Objects.

new Object[]{ "aaa", new Object(), new ArrayList(), {} };
//{} is not a valid way to create an Object here.
However, it is valid while creating an array.
For example, the following are valid:
String[] sa = { }; //assigns a valid String[] object of length 0 to sa
Object arr[][] = new Object[][] {new String[5], {} };
//assigns a valid Object[] object of length 0 to arr[1].

new Object[]{ "aaa", new Object(), new ArrayList(), new String[]{""} };//true
//Every array is an Object so new String[]{""} is also an Object and
can be placed in an array of objects.

new Object[1]{ new Object() };
//You can't specify array length if you are initializing it at the same place.

Explanation
1. An array of objects can store Objects of any class.
2. Primitives (i.e. int, byte, char, short, boolean, long, double, and float)
are NOT objects.
3. An array (of primitives as well as of objects) is an Object.
