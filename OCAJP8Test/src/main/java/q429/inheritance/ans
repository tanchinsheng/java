Explanation
As a rule, fields defined in an interface are public, static, and final.
The methods are public. Here, the interface IInt defines thevalue and thus
any class that implements this interface gets this field.
Therefore, it can be accessed using s.thevalue or just thevalue
inside the class. Also, since it is static, it can also be accessed
using IInt.thevalue or Sample.thevalue.
