Given:

int a = 1 + 2 + 3 * 4;
int b = 2 * 3 + 4;
int total = a + b;

What will be the value of total?

34

38

29

25 //true
// Multiplication has more precedence than addition.
So this will be evaluated as: int a = 1 + 2 + (3 * 4);
3+12
15

int b = 2 * 3 + 4;
6+4
10

So, total = 25


Explanation
You may get a few very simple questions about operator preference.
Simple school math trick of BODMAS can be used to evaluate the expressions.

B Brackets first
O Orders (i.e. Powers and Square Roots, etc.)
DM Division and Multiplication (left-to-right)
AS Addition and Subtraction (left-to-right)
