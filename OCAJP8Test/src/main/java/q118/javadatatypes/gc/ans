Explanation
The official exam objectives now explicitly mention Garbage collection.
All you need to know is:

1. An object can be made eligible for garbage collection by making sure
there are no references pointing to that object.

2. You cannot directly invoke the garbage collector. You can suggest the
JVM to perform garbage collection by calling System.gc();
