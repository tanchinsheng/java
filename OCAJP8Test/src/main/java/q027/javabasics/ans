You have written some Java code in MyFirstClass.java file.
Which of the following commands will you use to compile and run it.
(Assume that the code has no package declaration.)

javac MyFirstClass.java
javar MyFirstClass

javap MyFirstClass.java
javar MyFirstClass.java

java MyFirstClass.java
java MyFirstClass.class

javac MyFirstClass.java
javar MyFirstClass.java

javac MyFirstClass.java //true
java MyFirstClass

Explanation
Remember that java code must be written in a file with .java extension.
If you have a public class in the code, the name of the file must be same as the name of that public class.

Compilation and execution of a Java program is two step process. You first need to compile a java file
using a Java compiler. Oracle's JDK comes with a compiler. It is contained in the executable file named javac.
You will find it in <jdk installation folder>/bin.

javac compiles the source code and generates bytecode in a new file with the same name as the source file
but with extension .class. By default, the class file in generated in the same folder but javac is
capable of placing it in a different folder if you use the -d flag. [This is just FYI and not required for the exam.
-d is a very important and useful flag and we recommend that you read about it even if it is not required for the exam.]

In second step, the Java virtual machine (JVM), aka Java interpreter is invoked to execute the .class file.
Oracle's JVM is contained in the executable file named java. It is also present in the same
bin folder of JDK installation. It takes the fully qualified name (i.e. name including package)
of the class file without extension as a argument.
