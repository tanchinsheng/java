It will not compile

Explanation
This question is based on 2 concepts:

1. i == ++j is not same as i == j++; In the case of i == ++j, j is first incremented and then compared with i.
While in the case of i == j++;, j is first compared with i and then incremented.

2. The | operator, when applied for boolean operands, ensures that both the sides are evaluated.
This is opposed to || which does not evaluate the Right Hand Side if the result can be known by just evaluating the Left Hand Side.
Now, let us see the values of i and j at each step:

int i = 1;
int j = i++; // j is assigned 1 and i is incremented to 2
if( (i==++j) | (i++ == j) )     // increment j (so j becomes 2) and compare with i => return true.         
//since it is |, evaluate next condition: compare i with 2 and increment i => i becomes 3.{     
i+=j; //i = 3+2 = 5
} System.out.println(i); //prints 5
