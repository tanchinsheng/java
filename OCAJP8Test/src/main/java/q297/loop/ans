In such a question it is best to take a sample data such as INT1=1 and INT2=3 and execute the loops mentally. 
Eliminate the wrong options. In this case, the original loop will print:
=====ORIGINAL ====
1

2

Outputs of all the options are given above (Ignoring the line breaks).

Thus, none of them is same as the original.
