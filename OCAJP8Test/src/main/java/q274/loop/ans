Which of the following statements regarding 'break' and 'continue' are true?

break without a label, can occur only in a switch, while, do, or for statement.

continue without a label, can occur only in a switch, while, do, or for statement.
// It cannot occur in a switch.

break can never occur without a label.

continue can never occur WITH a label.

None of the above.

Explanation
A break statement with no label attempts to transfer control to the innermost enclosing switch, 
while, do, or for statement; this statement, which is called the break target, then immediately completes normally. 
If no switch, while, do, or for statement encloses the break statement, a compile-time error occurs.

A break statement with label Identifier attempts to transfer control to the enclosing labeled statement  
that has the same Identifier as its label; this statement, which is called the break target, 
then immediately completes normally. In this case, the break target need not be a while, do, for, or switch statement.

A continue statement with no label attempts to transfer control to the innermost enclosing while, 
do, or for statement; this statement, which is called the continue target, 
then immediately ends the current iteration and begins a new one. 
If no while, do, or for statement encloses the continue statement, a compile-time error occurs.

A continue statement with label Identifier attempts to transfer control to the enclosing labelled statement 
that has the same Identifier as its label; that statement, which is called the continue target, 
then immediately ends the current iteration and begins a new one. 
The continue target must be a while, do, or for statement or a compile-time error occurs. 
If no labelled statement with Identifier as its label contains the continue statement, a compile-time error occurs.
