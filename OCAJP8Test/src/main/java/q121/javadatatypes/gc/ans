After which line will the object created at line XXX be eligible for garbage collection?

//2

//3

//4

Never in this method. //true

Cannot be determined.

Explanation
Note that at line 2, c is assigned the reference of b. i.e. c starts pointing
to the object created at //XXX. So even if at //3 b and a are set to null,
the object is not without any reference.
Also, at //4 c is being returned. So the object referred to by c cannot be
garbage collected in this method!
