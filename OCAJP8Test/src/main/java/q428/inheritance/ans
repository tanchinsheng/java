An instance of TwoWheeler is also an instance of FourWheeler.//true

An instance of TwoWheeler is a valid instance of Automobile.//true

The use of inheritance is not justified here because a TwoWheeler is not really a FourWheeler in the real world

The code will compile only if name is removed from TwoWheeler.

The code will fail to compile.

Explanation
The use of inheritance in this code is not justifiable, since conceptually,
a TwoWheeler is-not-a FourWheeler.
