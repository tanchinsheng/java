What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?

The code will fail to compile, 'while' has an invalid condition expression.
//It is perfectly valid because b = !b; returns a boolean,
which is what is needed for while condition.

It will compile but will throw an exception at runtime.

It will print 3.//true
//The loop body is executed twice and the program will print 3.

It will go in an infinite loop.

It will print 1.

Explanation
Unlike the 'while(){}' loop, the 'do {} while()' loop executes at least once
because the condition is checked after the iteration.
