What can be inserted at // 1, which will make the object referred to by obj
eligible for garbage collection?

obj.destroy();

Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
//Execution of garbage collector doesn't make an object eligible for
garbage collection. So even if you try to invoke the garbage collector,
it will not destroy the object that is not eligible for garbage collection.
Also remember that calling System.gc() or Runtime.getRuntime().gc()
will not necessarily run the garbage collector. It only requests the
JVM to perform garbage collection but there is no guarantee that the JVM will do it.

By the way, System.gc() is equivalent to Runtime.getRuntime().gc().

obj = null;
//This will make the object eligible for GC because there are no other references to it.

obj.finalize()

obj.name = null; as well as obj = null;
//You don't need to do obj.name=null;
