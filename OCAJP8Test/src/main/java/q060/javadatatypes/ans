Explanation
This question tests your knowledge on the default values of uninitialized
primitives and object references. booleans are initialized to false,
numeric types to 0 and object references to null. Elements of arrays
are initialized to the default values of their types.
So, elements of a boolean array are initialized to false.

int, char, float to 0 and Objects to null.  In this case, b is false.
So the else part of if(b) is executed. ch is a numeric type to its value is 0.
ba[0] = false assigns false to ba[0] and returns false which is assigned to x.
Finally, x and ba[0] are printed as false false.
