It will print  "finally is always executed!"

It will not compile as there is no catch block.

It will not print anything. //true

An exception will be thrown

None of the above.

Explanation
finally is always executed (even if you throw an exception in try or catch) but this is the exception to the rule.
When you call System.exit(...); The JVM exits so there is no way to execute the finally block.
