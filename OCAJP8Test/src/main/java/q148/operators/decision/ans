The expression (a = b) does not compare the variables a and b, but rather assigns the value of b to the variable a. 
The result of the expression is the value being assigned. 
Since a and b are boolean variables, the value returned by the expression is also boolean. 
This allows the expressions to be used as the condition for an if-statement. 
if-clause and the else-clause can have empty statements. 
Empty statement ( i.e. just ; ) is a valid statement. 

But this is illegal : 
if (true) else; 
because the if part doesn't contain any valid statement. 
( A statement cannot start with an else!) 
So, the following is valid. 

if(true) if(false); 
because if(false); is a valid statement.
