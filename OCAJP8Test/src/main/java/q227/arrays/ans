Consider the following array definitions:
int[] array1, array2[];
int[][] array3;
int[] array4[], array5[];

Which of the following are valid statements?

array2 = array3; //true

array2 = array4; //true

array1 = array2;

array4 = array1;

array5 = array3; //true

Explanation
There is a subtle difference between: int[] i; and int i[]; although in both the cases,
i is an array of integers. The difference is if you declare multiple variables in the
same statement such as: int[] i, j; and int i[], j;, j is not of the same type
in the two cases. In the first case, j is an array of integers while in the second case,
j is just an integer. Therefore, in this question: array1 is an array of int array2,
array3, array4, and array5  are arrays of int arrays Therefore, option 1, 2 and 5
are valid.
