How many objects have been created by the time the main method reaches
its end in the following code?

3

4 //true

5

6

Explanation
When a Noobs object is created, a MyException object is also created.
Therefore a total of 4 objects are created.
The line Noobs c = a; just assigns an existing Noobs object to c.
No new object is created.

Note: Some candidates have reported getting a similar question.
The question is ambiguous because two Class objects
(one for Noobs and one for MyException) are also created.
If you consider those, then the answer would be 6.
If you consider the String[] object referred to by args,
the answer would then be 8. Further, several Thread objects are
also created (although not directly by this code.)
Since this is out of scope for the exam,
it is best to ignore these kind of objects and consider only
the objects created directly by the code.
