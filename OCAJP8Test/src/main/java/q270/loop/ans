In such type of questions, you will need to work out the values of the loop variables 
for every iteration (unless you can recognize the pattern) on your worksheet.
Beginning i=0, j=10
Iteration 1: i<=j is true, i becomes 1 and j becomes 9
Iteration 2: i<=j is true, i becomes 2 and j becomes 8
Iteration 3: i<=j is true, i becomes 3 and j becomes 7
Iteration 4: i<=j is true, i becomes 4 and j becomes 6
Iteration 5: i<=j is true, i becomes 5 and j becomes 5
Iteration 6: i<=j is true, i becomes 6 and j becomes 4
Iteration 7: i<=j is false so the while loop is not entered.
Print 6 and 4.
