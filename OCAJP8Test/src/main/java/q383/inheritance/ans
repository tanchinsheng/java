Explanation
You cannot access c.i because i is private in B. But you can access ( (A)c).i
because i is public in A. Remember that member variables are hidden and not
overridden. So, B's i hides A's i and since B's i is private, you can't access
A's i unless you cast the reference to A. You cannot access c.j because j is
private in A.
