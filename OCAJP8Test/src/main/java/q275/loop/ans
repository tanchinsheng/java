Consider the following method which is called with an argument of 7:

What will it print? (Assume that Math.random() return a double between 0.0 and 1.0, \
not including 1.0)

It will print 1 and 2

It will print 1 to N where N is a random number.

It will not compile.//true
//Remember that a labeled break or continue statement must always exist inside
the loop where the label is declared. Here, if(j == 4) break POINT1; is a
labelled break that is occurring in the second loop while the label POINT1
is declared for the first loop


It will throw an exception at runtime.
