How can you declare a method someMethod() such that an instance of the class
is not needed to access it and all the members of the same package
have access to it.

public static void someMethod()//true

static void someMethod()//true

protected static void someMethod()//true

void someMethod()

protected void someMethod()

public abstract static void someMethod()
//static methods can't be abstract.

Explanation
Since the question says, "...an instance of the class is not needed...",
the method has to be static.
Also, as the question does not say that other packages should
have access to the method so public or protected is also correct.
