The code will compile but will always throw a DateTimeException (or its subclass) at run time.
//Note that LocalDateTime class does not contain Zone information but ISO_ZONED_DATE_TIME requires it.
Thus, it will throw the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" java.time.temporal.UnsupportedTemporalTypeException:

Unsupported field: OffsetSeconds  UnsupportedTemporalTypeException extends DateTimeException.

DateTimeException must either be caught or declared in the throws clause of this method.
//DateTimeException extends RuntimeException, so it need not be caught or declared in the throws clause.

The method parameter type must be changed from LocalDateTime to ZonedDateTime for it to compile.
//Although it is true that this code will never work at runtime, it will compile fine as it is.

It will return the date string as per the default time zone of the system on which it is run.
