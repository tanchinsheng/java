Which operators will always evaluate all the operands?

&&

|//true

||

?:
//If the condition before ? returns true, only the first operand will
be evaluated, otherwise only the second operand is evaluated.

%//true
//All mathematical operators evaluate all the operands.

Explanation
|| and && are also known as short circuit operators since they do not
evaluate the rest of the expression if the value of the expression can be
determined by just evaluating part of the expression for example
( true || (bool = false)) will not assign false to bool because
the value of the expression can be told just by seeing the first part
i.e. true. But ( true | (bool = false)) will assign false to bool.
