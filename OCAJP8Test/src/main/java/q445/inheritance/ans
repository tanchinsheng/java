Identify options that will compile and run without error.

a = (B)(I)b; //true
//class B does implement I because it extends A, which implements I.
A reference of type I can be cast to any class at compile time.
Since B is-a A, it can be assigned to a.

b = (B)(I) a
//This will fail at run time because a does not point to an object of class B.

a = (I) b;
//An I is not an A. Therefore, it will not compile.

I i = (C) a;
//It will compile because a C is-a A, which is-a I, and a reference of class A
can point to an object of class C. But it will fail at runtime because a does
not point to an object of class C.
