An overriding method must have a same parameter list and the same return type as that of the overridden method

true

false // correct

This would have been true prior to Java 1.5. But from Java 1.5, an overriding method is allowed to change 
the return type to any subclass of the original return type, also known as covariant return type. 
This does not apply to primitives, in which case, the return type of the overriding method must match 
exactly to the return type of the overridden method.
