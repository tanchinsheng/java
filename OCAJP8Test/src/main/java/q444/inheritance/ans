A method with no access modifier can be overridden by a method marked protected
(assuming that it is not final).

True//true

False

Explanation
An Overriding method is allowed to make the overridden method more accessible,
and since protected is more accessible than default (package), this is allowed.
Note that protected access will allow access to the subclass even if the subclass
is in a different package but package access will not.
