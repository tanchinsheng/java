What will be printed?

It will not compile.

Explanation
The call to printSum(1, 2) will be bound to printSum(int, int) because 1 and 2
are ints, which are exact match to int, int.  Note that if printSum(int, int)
method were not there in the code, printSum(double, double) would have been
invoked instead of printSum(Integer, Integer) because widening is preferred
over boxing/unboxing.  We advise you to run this program and try out various
combinations. The exam has questions on this pattern.
