What will be the result of attempting to compile and run class B?

It will not compile.

It will print 10 and then 10

It will print 20 and then 20

It will print 10 and then 20

It will print 20 and then 10//true

Explanation
Note that a final variable can be shadowed. Here, although fi in A is final,
it is shadowed by fi of B. So b.fi = 20; is valid since B's fi is not final.
