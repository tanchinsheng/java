Which line contains a valid constructor in the following class definition?

Line 1
//This cannot be a constructor because even the name of the method
( getInstance ) is not same as the class name!

Line 2
//Constructors cannot return anything. Not even void.

Line 3
//Constructors cannot return anything. Not even void.

Line 4
//This could have been a destructor in C++ world.
And there nothing like this in java. Java has a finalize() method,
which is similar to a destructor but does not work exactly as a destructor.

None of the above.//true
