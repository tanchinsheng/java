What will the following class print ?

It will print 8, 25

It will print 4, 5

It will print 14, 5

It will print 4, 25

It will print 14, 25 //true

Explanation
a += (a =4) is same as a = a + (a=4).
First, a's value of 10 is kept aside and (a=4) is evaluated.
The statement (a=4) assigns 4 to a and the whole statement returns the value 4.
Thus, 10 and 4 are added and assigned back to a.
Same logic applies to b = b + (b = 5); as well.
