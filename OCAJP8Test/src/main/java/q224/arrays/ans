 The above program is compiled with the command line:

javac FunWithArgs.java
and then run with:
java FunWithArgs a b c
What will be the output?

It will not compile.

It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at run time.

It will print b //true

It will print null

Explanation
There is no problem with the code. The main method is just overloaded.
When it is run, the main method with String[] will be called.
 This method then calls the main with String[][] with an argument
{ {"a", "b", "c"} }  Thus, args[0][1] refers to "b",
which is what is printed.
