If you run the following program by changing the accessibility from public to private and protected,
it may work on some versions of Java.

However, for the purpose of Java Certification exam, it should be assumed that for the JVM to execute a class
using the standard main method, the accessibility of the main method must be public.

package test;
public class TestClass{     
    private static void main(String args[]){          
        System.out.println("hello");     
    }
}
