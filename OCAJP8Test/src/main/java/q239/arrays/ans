What would be the result of trying to compile and run the following program?

The program will fail to compile, because of uninitialized variable 'bool'.
//No, All the instance variables are initialized by default values.

The program will throw a java.lang.NullPointerException when run.
//No reason for this at all.

The program will print "0 null false".//true

The program will print "0 null true".
//All the variables, including the array elements, will be initialized to
their default values.

The program will print null and false but will print junk value for ia[0].
//All the elements of the arrays of primitives are initialized to default values.

Explanation
Following are the default values that instance variables are initialized
with if not initialized explicitly:
types (byte, short, char, int, long, float, double) to 0 ( or 0.0 ).
All Object types to null.
boolean to false.
