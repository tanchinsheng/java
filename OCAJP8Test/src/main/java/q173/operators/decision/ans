The value 1 of k is saved by the compound assignment operator += before its right-hand operand (k = 4) * (k + 2) is evaluated. 
Evaluation of this right-hand operand then assigns 4 to k, calculates the value 6 for k + 2, 
and then multiplies 4 by 6 to get 24. This is added to the saved value 1 to get 25, 
which is then stored into k by the += operator. 

An identical analysis applies to the case that uses a[0].   
k += (k = 4) * (k + 2);   
a[0] += (a[0] = 4) * (a[0] + 2);   
k = k + (k = 4) * (k + 2);   
a[0] = a[0] + (a[0] = 4) * (a[0] + 2);
