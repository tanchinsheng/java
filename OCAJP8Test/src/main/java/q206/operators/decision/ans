What will the following code print when run?

apple
cat
none

apple
cat

cat
none//true
//Since there is a case condition that matches the input string "c",
that case statement will be executed directly. This prints "cat".
Since there is no break after this case statement and the next case statement,
the control will fall through the next one (which is default : ) and so
"none" will be printed as well.

cat
