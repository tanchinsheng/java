Given the following declaration, select the correct way to get the number of
elements in the array, assuming that the array has been initialized.

int[] intArr;


intArr[ ].length( )

intArr.length( )

intArr.length//true
//Each array object has a member variable named public final length of type
'int' that contains the size of the array.

intArr[ ].size( )

intArr.size( )

FYI, All types of arrays are objects. i.e. intArr instanceof Object is true.
