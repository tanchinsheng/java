What is the correct declaration for an abstract method 'add' in a class that is
accessible to any class, takes no arguments and returns nothing?

public void add();
//An abstract method must have the abstract keyword and must not have a method body
i.e. { }.

abstract add();
//A method that is not supposed to return anything must specify void as its return type.

abstract null add();
//A method that is not supposed to return anything must specify void as its return type.
null is not a  type, though it is a valid return value for any reference type.

abstract public void add(){ }
//It is invalid because has a method body i.e. { }.

abstract public void add() throws Exception;//true
