What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?

The code will compile without error and will terminate without problems when run.//true

The code will fail to compile, since the continue can't be used this way.

The code will fail to compile, since the break can't be used this way.

The code will fail to compile, since the for statement in line 2 is invalid.

The code will compile without error but will never terminate.
//the condition part is 'false' so the control will never go inside the loop.

Explanation
A continue statement can occur in and only in a for, while or do-while loop.
A continue statement means: Forget about the rest of the statements in the loop
and start the next iteration.
So,
for (i=1 ;  i<5  ; i++) continue; just increments the value of i up to 5 because of i++.
for (i=0 ;       ; i++) break; iterates only once because of the break so the
value of i becomes 0.
for (    ; i<5?false:true ;    ); never iterates because i is less than 5
(it is 0 because of //2) and the condition expression is false!
At the end of the code, the value of i is 0.
