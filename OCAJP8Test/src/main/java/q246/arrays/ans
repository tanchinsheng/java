What will be the result of trying to compile and execute the following program?

It will throw ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at Runtime.

Compile time Error.

It will print 10 20 30

It will print 30 20 30 //true

It will print 0 20 30

The statement iA[i] = i = 30 ; will be processed as follows:
iA[i] = i = 30; => iA[0] = i = 30 ;  =>  i = 30; iA[0] = i ; =>   iA[0] = 30 ;

Here is what JLS says on this:
1 Evaluate Left-Hand Operand First
2 Evaluate Operands before Operation
3 Evaluation Respects Parentheses and Precedence
4 Argument Lists are Evaluated Left-to-Right

For Arrays: First, the dimension expressions are evaluated, left-to-right.
If any of the expression evaluations completes abruptly, the expressions to the right of it are not evaluated.
