Explanation
Here, we have three overloaded probe methods but there is no probe method that
takes a String parameter. The only one that is able to accept a String is the
one that takes Object as a parameter. So that method will be called.

A String cannot be assigned to a variable of class Integer or Long variable,
but it can be assigned to a variable of class Object.
