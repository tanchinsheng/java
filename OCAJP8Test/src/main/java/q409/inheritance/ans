What will be the output when class B is run ?

It will print A, 4.

It will print A, A

It will print 0, 4//true

It will print 4, 4

None of the above.

Explanation
Note that method print() is overridden in class B. Due to polymorphism,
the method to be executed is selected depending on the class of the actual object.
Here, when an object of class B is created, first A's constructor is called,
which in turn calls print(). Now, since the class of actual object is B,
B's print() is selected. At this point of time,
variable i has not been initialized (because we are still initializing
A at this point), so its default value i.e. 0 is printed.
This happens because the method print() is non-private, hence polymorphic.
Finally, 4 is printed.

Further Explanation
You can access the instance members before explicit initialization
because they are always initialized to default values first.
