Which of the following are valid declarations in a class?

abstract int absMethod(int param) throws Exception; // Correct

abstract native int absMethod(int param) throws Exception; //Wrong
native method cannot be abstract.

float native getVariance() throws Exception; //Wrong
return type should always be on the immediate left of method name.

abstract private int absMethod(int param) throws Exception; //Wrong
private method cannot be abstract. A private method is not inherited so how can a subclass implement it?
