Which of the following is/are valid double values for 10 million? (A million has 6 zeros)

double d = 10,000,000.0;
// Comma is not a valid character here.

double d = 10-000-000;
//Dash (-) is not a valid character here.

double d = 10_000_000;

double d = 10 000 000;

Explanation
Beginning with Java 7, you can include underscores in between the digits.
This helps in writing long numbers.
For example, if you want to write 1 million, you can write: 1_000_000,
which is easier than 1000000 for humans to interpret.

Note that you cannot start or end a value with an underscore though.
Thus, 100_ or _100 are invalid values. _100 is actually a valid variable name!

You may use underscore for all kinds of numbers including long, double,
float, binary, as well as hex.  
For example, the following are all valid numbers -
int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE;
float f = 9898_7878.333_333f;
int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;
