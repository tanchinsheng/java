What is the correct parameter specification for the standard main method?

void

String[ ] args //true

Strings args[ ]

String args

String args[ ] //true

Explanation
There is a no difference for args whether it is defined as String[] args or String args[].
However, there is an important difference in the way it is defined as illustrated by the following:

1. String[] sa1, sa2;
Here, both - sa1 and sa2 are String arrays.

2. String sa1[], sa2;
Here, only sa1 is a String array. sa2 is just a String.
