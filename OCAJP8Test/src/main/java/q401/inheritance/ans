What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?

The program will fail to compile.

Class cast exception at runtime.

It will print 30, 20.//true

It will print 30, 30.

It will print 20, 20.

Explanation
Remember : variables are SHADOWED and methods are OVERRIDDEN. Which variable will be
used depends on the class that the variable is declared of. Which method will be used
depends on the actual class of the object that is referenced by the variable.
So, in line o1.m1(), the actual class of the object is C, so C's m1() will be used.
So it returns 30. In line o2.i, o2 is declared to be of class B, so B's i is used.
So it returns 20.
