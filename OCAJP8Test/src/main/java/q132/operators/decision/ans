Given the following LOCs:     

    int rate = 10;    
    XXX amount = 1 - rate/100*1 - rate/100;

What can XXX be?

only int or long

only long or double

only double

double or float

long or double but not int or float.

int, long, float or double //true

Explanation
Note that none of the terms in the expression 1 - rate/100*1 - rate/100;
is double or float. They are all ints. So the result of the expression
will be an int. Since an int can be assigned to a variable of type int,
long, float or double, amount can be int, long, float or double.
