to loopTest()?

The program will not compile.

It will print 1 2 3 4//true

It will print 1 1 2 3 4

It will print 1 1 2 2 3 3 4 4

Produces no output

Explanation
When x is 0, the statement continue loop; is executed. Note that loop: is for
the outer loop. So, only one iteration (that too not full) is performed for the
inner loop.
So, the inner loop prints the value of i only once and then next iteration of
outer loop starts. 'j' is never printed. So, it prints 1 2 3 4.
