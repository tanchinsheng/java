Casting a base class to a subclass as in : b = (B) a; is also called as narrowing 
(as you are trying to narrow the base class object to a more specific class object) and needs explicit cast. 
Casting a sub class to a base class as in: A a = b; is also called as widening and does not need any casting.  
For example, consider two classes: Automobile and Car, where Car extends Automobile Now, 
Automobile a = new Car(); is valid because a car is definitely an Automobile. 
So it does not need an explicit cast.  But, Car c = a; is not valid because 'a' is an Automobile and it may be a Car, a Truck, 
or a MotorCycle, so the programmer has to explicitly let the compiler know that at runtime 'a' will point to an object of class Car. 
Therefore, the programmer must use an explicit cast: Car c = (Car) a;
