Which of the following options can be inserted in PremiumAccount independent of each other?

static String getId(){   return "1111"; }
//You cannot override a static method with a non-static method and vice-versa.

String getId();//true
//An interface can redeclare a default method and also make it abstract.

default String getId(){    return "1111"; };//true
//An interface can redeclare a default method and provide a different implementation.

abstract static String getName();
//1. static methods can never be abstract (neither in an interface not in a class).
2. An interface can have a static method but the method must have a body.

static String getName();
//An interface can have a static method but the method must have a body.

default String getName();
//A default method must have a body.
