What, if anything, is wrong with the following code?

TestClass cannot implement them both because it leads to ambiguity.

There is nothing wrong with the code.

The code will work fine only if VALUE is removed from one of the interfaces.

The code will work fine only if m1() is removed from one of the interfaces.

None of the above.

Explanation
Having ambiguous fields or methods does not cause any problems by itself but referring to
such fields/methods in an ambiguous way will cause a compile time error.
So you cannot call : System.out.println(VALUE); because it will be ambiguous (there are two VALUE definitions).

But the following lines are valid :  TestClass tc = new TestClass(); System.out.println(( ( T1) tc).VALUE);

However, explicit cast is not required for calling the method m1() : ( ( T2) tc).m1(); tc.m1() is also fine
because even though m1() is declared in both the interfaces,
the definition to both resolves unambiguously to only one m1(), which is defined in TestClass.
