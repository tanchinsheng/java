Explanation
There are two points to understand here:

1. Even if the program is executed without any arguments, the 'args' is NOT NULL. 
In such case it will be initialized to an array of Strings containing zero elements.

2. The finally block is always executed, no matter how control leaves the try block. 
Only if, in a try or catch block, System.exit() is called then finally will not be executed.
