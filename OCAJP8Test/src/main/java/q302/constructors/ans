Given the following source code, which of the lines that are commented out may be
reinserted without introducing errors?

final void h( ) { } //(1)
//It will fail because BigBang will try to override a final method.

BigBang(int n) { m = n; }  //(2)
//It will fail since BigBang will no longer have a default constructor that is
used in the main( ) method.

void k( ) { i++; }   //(3)//true

void l( ) { j++; }  //(4)
//It will fail since the method will try to access a private member 'j' of
the superclass.

abstract void f( ) ;  //(0)
//If this line is inserted, then either the class BigBang will have to be
declared abstract or it has to implement method f().

Explanation
Default constructor (having no arguments) is automatically created only if
the class does not define any constructors.
So as soon as //2 is inserted the default constructor will not be created.
