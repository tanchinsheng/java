Explanation
An overriding method can be made less restrictive than the overridden method. The restrictiveness of access modifiers is as follows:
private>default>protected>public (where private is most restrictive and public is least restrictive).

Note that there is no modifier named default. The absence of any access modifiers implies default access.
