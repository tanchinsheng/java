What will the following code print when compiled and run?

7

8

9

10//true

11

Explanation
The point to note here is that a break without any label breaks the innermost outer loop.
So in this case, whenever k>j, the C loop breaks.
You should run the program and follow it step by step to understand how it progresses.

i,j,k
0,0,0 c=1
0,0,1 c=2
0,0,2

0,1,0 c=3
0,1,1 c=4
0,1,2 c=5

1,0,0 c=6
1,0,1 c=7
1,0,2

1,1,0 c=8
1,1,1 c=9
1,1,2 c=10
