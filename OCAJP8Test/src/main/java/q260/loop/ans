1. The while condition uses post increment operator, which means count
is first compared with 11
(and based on this comparison a decision is made whether to execute the
loop again or not) and then incremented.
So when count is 10, the condition 10<11 is true (that means the loop
needs to be executed again)
and count is incremented to 11.

2. When count is completely divisible by 3,
(i.e. when count is 0, 3, 6, 9) sum+=count; is not executed.

Thus, the result is the summation of: 1 2 4 5 7 8 10 11
