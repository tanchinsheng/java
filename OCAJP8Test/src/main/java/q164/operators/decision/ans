Explanation
This is a simple but frustratingly time consuming question.
Expect such questions in the exam.
For such questions, it is best to keep track of each variable on the notepad after executing each line of code.

The final values of the variables are as follows
- x=2 y=1 z=1 a=1 b=2

The expression x>a?y>b?y:b:x>z?x:z; should be grouped as -
x > a  ? (y>b ? y : b)  :  (x>z ? x : z);

It will, therefore, assign 2 to answ.
