Assume that a method named 'method1' contains code which may raise a non-runtime (checked) Exception.
What is/are the possible way(s) to declare this method so that it indicates that it expects the caller to handle that exception?

public void method1() throws Throwable //true

public void method1() throw Exception
//Note that it should be 'throws' and not 'throw'

public void method1() throw new Exception
//This is not the right syntax.

public void method1() throws Exception //true

public void method1()
//Non runtime exception must be declared in the throws clause.
