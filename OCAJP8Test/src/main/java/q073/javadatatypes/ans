5 and 20

6 and 515

6 and 20 //true

6 and 615

It will not compile.

Explanation
1. Wrapper objects are always immutable.
Therefore, when dataWrapper is passed into wiggler() method,
it is never changed even when x++; is executed.
However, x, which was pointing to the same object as dataWrapper,
is assigned a new Integer object (different from dataWrapper)
containing 6.

2. If both the operands of the + operator are numeric,
it adds the two operands. Here, the two operands are Integer 5 and
Integer 15, so it unboxes them, adds them, and prints 20.
