What can be inserted in the following code so that it will print
exactly 2345 when compiled and run?

break;  and //nothing is required

continue;
and
//nothing is required //true

continue;
and
continue; //true

break; and continue;

break; and break;

Explanation
This is a very simple loop to follow if you know what break and continue do.
break breaks the nearest outer loop. Once a break is encountered, no
further iterations of that loop will execute.
continue simply starts the next iteration of the loop. Once a continue
is encountered, rest of the statements within that loop are ignored
(not executed ) and the next iteration is started.
