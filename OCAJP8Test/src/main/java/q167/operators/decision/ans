Which of the following statements are true?

The modulus operator % can only be used with integer operands.

& can have integral as well as boolean operands.

The arithmetic operators *, / and % have the same level of precedence.

&& can have integer as well as boolean operands.
//It can be used on floating points operands also. For example, 5.5 % 3 = 2.5

~ can have integer as well as boolean operands.
//unlike &&, & will not "short circuit" the expression if used on boolean parameters.

Note :
integral types means byte, short, int, long, and char

As per Section 4.1 of JLS 8 -

The integral types are byte, short, int, and long, whose values are 8-bit,
16-bit, 32-bit and 64-bit
signed two's-complement integers, respectively, and char, whose values
are 16-bit unsigned integers representing UTF-16 code units.
