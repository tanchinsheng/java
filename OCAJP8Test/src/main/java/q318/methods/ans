What should be the return type of the following method?
public RETURNTYPE methodX( byte by){
    double d = 10.0;
    return (long) by/d*3;
}

int

long

double

float

byte

Explanation
Note that the cast (long) applies to 'by' not to the whole expression.
( (long) by ) / d * 3; Now, division operation on long gives you a double.
So the return type should be double.
