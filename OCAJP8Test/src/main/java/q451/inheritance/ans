Which of the following lines of code can be used to complete the above code?

class Shape {
and
class Circle  extends Shape {
//Since there is an abstract method in the first class, the class must be declared abstract.

public class Shape {
and
class Circle  extends Shape {
//class keyword is missing from the first declaration.

public abstract class Shape {
and
class Circle  extends Shape {//true

public abstract class Shape {
and
class Circle  implements Shape {
//You can only implement an interface not a class. So Circle implements shape is wrong.

public interface Shape {
and
class Circle  implements Shape {
//By default all the methods of an interface are public and abstract so there
is no need to explicitly specify the "abstract" keyword for the draw() method
if you make Shape an interface. But it is not wrong to do so.
