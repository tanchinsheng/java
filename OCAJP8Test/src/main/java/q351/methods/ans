Which of the statements regarding the following code are correct?

The code will fail to compile because the constructor is trying to access static members.
//A constructor (or any other method) can access static members.

The code will fail to compile because the constructor is trying to use static
member variable a before it has been initialized.
//static fields are always initialized automatically if you do not initialize
them explicitly. So are instance fields.

The code will fail to compile because the constructor is trying to use member
variable b before it has been initialized.

The code will fail to compile because the constructor is trying to use
local variable c before it has been initialized.
////c is getting initialized at line 2: c = a;

The code will compile and run without any problem. //true

Explanation
All the instance or static variables are given a default values if not explicitly
initialized. All numeric variable are given a value of zero or equivalent to zero
(i.e. 0.0 for double or float ).
booleans are initialized to false and objects references are initialized to null.
