Given the following code, which statements are true?

Class B extends class A.// Correct

Class B is the superclass of class A.//False
A is the super class of B.

Class A inherits from class B.//False
B inherits from A

Class B is a subclass of class A.//Correct
Class B is a subclass of class A. Given the declaration "class B extends A" we can conclude that class B extends class A,
class A is the superclass of class B, class B is a subclass of class A, and class B inherits from class A,
which means that objects of class B also have all the members that objects of class A have.

Objects of class B will always have a member variable named i .//Correct
Note that 'i' is not public or protected. So it will be inherited only if both the classes are in same package.

Explanation
Here are a few good words from the Java Language Specification:
Members of a class that are declared private are not inherited by subclasses of that class.
Only members of a class that are declared protected or public are inherited by subclasses
declared in a package other than the one in which the class is declared.
Constructors and static initializers are not members and therefore are not inherited.
