What will the following class print when executed?

true, false, true

true, true, false

true, false, false //true

true, true, true

Explanation
Java parses the expression from left to right.
Once it realizes that the left operand of a conditional "or"
operator has evaluated to true, it does not even try to evaluate
the right side expression.
