It will not compile as it is.
// There is no problem with the existing code.

It will throw an Exception at runtime if it is run as it is.
// Soccer s = (Soccer) g; is a valid because g does refer to an object of class Soccer at run time.
// So there will be no exception at run time.

g.play(); at //1 and s.play("cosco"); at //2
// This is valid because g is of type Game, which has the no-args play method 
// and s is of type Soccer, which has defined play(String ) method.

g.play(); at //1 and s.play(); at //2
// This is valid because g is of type Game, which has the no-args play method and 
// s is of type Soccer, which inherits that method.

g.play("cosco"); at //1 and s.play("cosco"); at //2
// g.play("cosco") is not valid because even though the object referred to by g is of class Soccer, 
// the reference type of g is Game, which does not have play(String ) method.
