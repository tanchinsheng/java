Identify the correct statements.

Line 3 is not valid. //true

Line 2 is not valid. //true

It will compile because both short and char can hold 10.

None of the lines 1, 2 and 3 is valid.
//Line 1 is valid because 10 is a constant and can fit into a short.

Explanation
Not all short values are valid char values, and neither are all char values
valid short values, therefore compiler complains for both the lines 2 and 3.
They will require an explicit cast.
