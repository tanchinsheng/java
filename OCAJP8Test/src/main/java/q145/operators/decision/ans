What will the following program print?

true //true

false

It will not compile.

It will compile but throw an exception at run time.

None of the above.

Explanation
Object class's equals() method just checks whether the two references are
pointing to the same location or not. In this case they really are pointing
to the same location because of obj2 = obj1; so it returns true.
