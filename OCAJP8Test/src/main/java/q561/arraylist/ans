Identify the correct statements about ArrayList?

Standard JDK provides no subclasses of ArrayList. //true
//It does.
Direct Known Subclasses:
AttributeList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList

You cannot store primitives in an ArrayList.
//This is true because only Objects can be stored in it.

It allows constant time access to all its elements. //true
//This is true because it implements java.util.RandomAccess interface,
which is a marker interface that signifies that you can directly access any element of this collection.
This also implies that it takes the same amount of time to access any element.

(Compare that with a LinkedList, which takes more time to access the last element than the first element.)

ArrayList cannot resize dynamically if you add more number of elements than its capacity.
//It does resize dynamically. Compare that to an array, which cannot be resized once created.

An ArrayList is backed by an array. //true
//This is true because the elements are actually stored in an array and that is why is it called an ArrayList.
(The expression "backed by an array" means that the implementation of ArrayList actually uses an array to store elements.)

Explanation
ArrayList is a subclass of AbstractList.
java.lang.Object
-  java.util.AbstractCollection<E>    
    -    java.util.AbstractList<E>      
        -      java.util.ArrayList<E>

All Implemented Interfaces: Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable<E>, Collection<E>, List<E>, RandomAccess

Direct Known Subclasses: AttributeList, RoleList, RoleUnresolvedList
