What will be the result of compiling and running the class?

It will print Hello World.

It will print Static Hello World.

Compilation error at line 2.

Compilation error at line 3.//true
//It will say, method sayHello() is already defined.

Runtime Error.

Explanation
You cannot have two methods with the same signature (name and parameter types)
in one class. Also, even if you put one sayHello() method in other class which
is a subclass of this class, it won't compile because you cannot override/hide
a static method with a non static method and vice versa.
