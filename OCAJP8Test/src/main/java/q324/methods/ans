This question is based on the principle that primitives are always passed by value. 
Thus, when you pass a to update() method, the value of a is passed. 
The variable a in update() method is not same as the a in main(). 
It is a completely different variable and so updating update() method's a does not affect main()'s a. 
Therefore, we need to return the new value from update() method and assign it to main()'s a.  

The following is the complete code listing:  
public class Updater {   
    public int update(int a, int offset){     
        a = a + offset;     
        return a;   
    }    

    public static void main(String[] args) {     
        Updater u = new Updater();     
        int a = 99;     
        a = u.update(a, 111);     
        System.out.println(a);   
    } 
}
