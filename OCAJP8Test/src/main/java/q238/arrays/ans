null
null

It will throw a RuntimeException at run time. //true
//When you do new String[2], you create a String array of two elements.
arr is therefore not null. But each element of the array is not given any value
and is therefore null. When you call a method on that element
(i.e. str.concat(str+" "+ind); in initData), it will generate a NullPointerException,
which is a RuntimeException.
